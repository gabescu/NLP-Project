ai01;Remember, this shield charm is our armor against the dark forces.

ai06;What's this potion here?

ai08;And this creature?
ai09;A Bowtruckle. Guardians of wand-wood trees. Useful, aren't they?
ai10;Definitely. I wish I could see Thestrals.
ai11;Be glad you can't. It means you've been spared from grief.
ai12;I want to be an Auror, fight against the darkness.
ai13;You will. We all will.
ai14;Dark Arts are rising. We must be ready.
ai15;The Ministry won't help us. We're on our own.
ai16;That's why we have the DA. To learn, to fight.
ai17;Fight and survive. For our future.
ai18;For everyone's future.

ai20;And right now, we need hope.
ai21;Hope, and the strength to resist.
ai22;We'll meet again next week. Keep practicing.
ai23;Stay vigilant. Stay brave.
ai24;Always.
