500001;Oh, it's you.
500002;What should we do with him, Big D?
500003;Big D? Cool name, but to me, you'll always be Ikkle Duddicums.
500004;Shut up!
500005;Ooo, tough guy. Not so tough in your bed, are you?
500006;What?
500007;You boys go home now, or I'll be calling your parents!
500008;"I heard you talking in your sleep, last night. Crying. ""No, don't kill Cedric, don't kill Cedric! Dad, help me, heeelp me! He's going to kill me! Boo-hoo!"""
500009;Shut up, Dudley. I'm warning you...
500010;Why should I?
500011;Because if you don't I'll turn you into the idiot pig you are!
500012;Not so brave now, are you Duddykins? Now tell your little friends to go away.
500013;G-go home!
500014;What?
500015;Get out of here!
500016;Don't you ever speak about that again. You understand?
500017;Don't point that thing at me!
500018;I said, DO YOU UNDERSTAND? !
500019;What's happening?
500020;Quiet!
500021;Dudley! Run!
500022;Come on! They break into a run. A dementor drifts into the alleyway in front of them. Skidding to a stop, Harry turns around, to find the other dementor cutting off the way back.
500023;Dudley, no!
500024;Lumos!
500025;"""Expecto Patronum!'"
500026;Bow to death, Harry...
500027;Haaaaaaaarry!...
500028;"""Expecto Patronum! '"
500029;What the heii are those?
500030;Dementors.
500031;What happened, Duddikins?
500032;What the hell is a dementoid?
500033;They didn't--?
500034;No.
500035;I want some answers!
500036;We were attacked.
500037;By those...things?
500038;They're evil. If they get the chance, they'll suck your soul out through your mouth.
500039;How do you know that?
500040;Fought 'em off, eh, Dud? Gave 'em the ol' one-two?
500041;You can't give a Dementor the 'ol one-two.'
500042;Why is he all right then?
500043;Because I used magic to save his
500044;Lumos!
500045;Who are all you lot?
500046;Quiet, Dursley.
500047;Harry, douse the light. We're exposed here.
500048;What are you doing here?
500049;We're your advanced guard, Harry. Dumbledore just sent us as soon as he heard about the attack. We're taking you to safety. We're just waiting for the all clear.
500050;How'd he know? It just happened!
500051;You didn't think Dumbledore'd let you wander around on your own, did you?
500052;Harry, I don't believe you've met Nymphadora Tonks.
500053;Tonks, would you go get Harry's broom from the house?
500054;What's been going on? What's Lord Vol-
500055;We're not talking about it here, it's too risky.
500056;Blast it.
500057;Mad-eye, dear, you do realize that's disgusting?
500058;I want 365 degree visibility on the return trip.
500059;How are we getting there?
500060;Brooms.
500061;There's the first signal.
500062;Right, let's go.
500063;On your broom, Harry.
500064;Form up! Form up around Harry. Make it snappy! The advanced guard surrounds Harry.
500065;Stop being so cheerful, Mad-eye.
500066;We must be ready. This would be the perfect moment for Voldemort to strike Harry.
500067;Uh, is that very likely?
500068;No one's going to die.
500069;There's the second signal!
500070;Mount your brooms, everyone. Here we go!
500071;The third signal, everyone. Let's
500072;Stay in formation!
500073;We need more height!
500074;Contacts to the south!
500075;Mad-eye! You, Tonks, and Lupin take Harry! We'll slow them down!
500076;There's the other one, Alastor!
500077;Expecto--!
500078;Harry, leave it to us!
500079;No!
500080;"""Expecto Patronum!'"
500081;Get Harry to the safe house!
500082;Come on, Potter! Keep moving!
500083;But I can help!
500084;Potter, getting yourself killed won't do a thing. Now move!
500085;We're not far, now!
500086;Did you get rid of them?
500087;They're gone, Alastor.
500088;We're there!
500089;Prepare for descent! Form up around Harry!
500090;Stay here, Harry.
500091;Clear!
500092;Right, Harry, this way.
500093;Here, read this.
500094;Come on, inside. Hurry.
500095;Get in, quick, Harry. Don't touch anything.
500096;Filth! Scum! Half-breeds, mutants, freaks, begone from this place! How dare you befoul the house of my fathers?!
500097;Shut up, you miserable old hag! Quiet!
500098;Blood traitor, abomination, shame of my flesh!
500099;Was that your--?
500100;Mother, yes. Dear old mum.
500101;But...why here?
500102;Hello, Harry dear.
500103;Mrs. Weasley!
500104;Sirius, the meeting is about to start!
500105;Right.
500106;Harry, dear, go on upstairs-— quietly, if you please. They're all up there.
500107;Harry!
500108;Let him breathe, Hermione!
500109;Oh, Harry! We've missed you! Are you furious with us, I bet you are!
500110;Good to see you, mate.
500111;Come on, inside.
500112;Sorry we haven't written, Harry, but Dumbledore made us promise not to.
500113;We wanted to, mate, we really did, but he thought they would get intercepted. There is an awkward silence.
500114;Right.
500115;He thought you would be safest there.
500116;He was so angry when he heard. It was...scary...
500117;So, why's he keeping me in the dark?
500118;Didn't you bother asking?
500119;We've only seen him twice, and not for very long. He's really busy.
500120;So I get to spend the summer with the Dursleys while you two are here.
500121;It's not that fun, mate. Mum won't let us anywhere near the meetings.
500122;You've still been here!
500123;What's been going on?
500124;We've already told you, we're not privyed to the meetings. But we do know a few things.
500125;Some of the Order are following known Death Eaters, like Lucious Malfoy.
500126;What's this Order everyone's talking about?
500127;The Order of the Phoenix. Dumbledore started it last time to fight You-Know-Who. He only reorganized it after last term.
500128;You can come down now, the meeting's over.
500129;Arthur-
500130;Well, the Ministry is furious with you.
500131;Why?
500132;You'll have to go to an disciplinary meeting tomorrow.
500133;Okay.
500134;I'm not really hungry. I think I'll go to bed.
500135;You surprise me, Harry. I figured the first thing you'd do is start asking about Voldemort.
500136;I wanted to, but I didn't think you'd tell me anything.
500137;And that was quite right, Harry! You're much to young--
500138;He has a right to know, Molly.
500139;It's not your decision!
500140;I know what Dumbledore said, but he needs to know something.
500141;He's not a child, Molly.
500142;He's not an adult either!
500143;I only have Harry's best interests at heart.
500144;He's not your son.
500145;Who else does he have, then?
500146;He's got me. He's like a son to me.
500147;What do you want to know, Harry?
500148;Where's Voldemort? What's he doing?
500149;He's hiding for the moment, because the Ministry is ignoring his return and he doesn't want that to change.
500150;How?
500151;The last person You-Know-Who wanted to alert was Dumbledore.
500152;And what's his plan?
500153;He's building up his army again, just like before.
500154;And you're stopping him from gaining followers?
500155;We're doing our best, but it's proving to be...difficult.
500156;You see, when the Ministry of Magic insists that Voldemort isn't back.
500157;But...why?
500158;Fudge likes being Minister of Magic. If it turns out that Voldemort came back under his watch, he'll be sacked.
500159;But you're telling people, right?
500160;Well, they think I'm a mass- murderer, Lupin is a werewolf, Tonks and Arthur would lose their jobs at the Ministry...
500161;But Dumbledore is doing all he can.
500162;If he keeps it up, he might end up in Azkaban. And that would give You- Know-Who a clear field to--
500163;What?
500164;You-Know-Who wants something. Something he didn't have last time. A weapon.
500165;What kind of weapon?
500166;I'm sorry, Harry, we can't say anything more.
500167;Morning, dear! Did you have a good sleep?
500168;No, my scar kept hurting.
500169;Yeah...nerves...
500170;Good luck, Harry!
500171;They'll have to let you off, Harry... You were defending
500172;Thanks, Hermione.
500173;What does he get a hug for?
500174;Oh, sure, that's why.
500175;Me? Jealous? Of course not, it just doesn't seem fair that you hug one friend more than the other, is all...
500176;Would you like a hug?
500177;Well, come on, Harry. Time to go.
500178;Bye.
500179;Good, good, not very many Muggles.
500180;Well, come on Harry, in we go.
500181;I do love using the Fellytone! Now, let's see, what's the number again...
500182;Welcome to the Ministry of Magic. Please state your business.
500183;Harry Potter, disciplinary hearing.
500184;Pleas stand by.
500185;Keep close, Harry!
500186;Ah, Perkins, good morn-
500187;Arthur, they've changed the time of Potter's hearing.
500188;Blast! Dumbledore thought they might try that.
500189;It started at eight!
500190;Good lord, that was five minutes ago! Come on, Harry!
500191;Department of Mysteries.
500192;Department of Mysteries?
500193;Yep, I've got no idea what they get up to in here, it's top secret.
500194;Come on, Harry!
500195;I've been there before...
500196;Now, Harry, I find that highly unlikely...
500197;There you are, Harry, in you go...good luck...
500198;You're late.
500199;Er...sorry.
500200;No matter, the accused will take his seat.
500201;Very well, we are ready to begin.
500202;Witness for the Defence, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore.
500203;Ah...you...er...got our message that the time had changed, did you?
500204;Well. The...ah...charges.
500205;The charges against the accused shall now be read into the record: That the accused did with deliberation and fore-knowledge of the illegality of his actions, produce a patronus charm in full sight of a Muggle.
500206;Yes.
500207;Yes, but-
500208;Within full sight of a Muggle?
500209;Yes, but-
500210;You produced a Patronus? A fully- formed Patronus, with a clearly- defined shape?
500211;Yes.
500212;That is most remarkable, Mr. Potter.
500213;It doesn't matter how impressive it was!
500214;But I did it because of the Dementors!
500215;What do you mean?
500216;My cousin and I were attacked by Dementors. That's why I had to use the Patronus, to drive them away.
500217;Ah, yes, yes, another cock-and-bull story.
500218;Dementors in Little Whinging?
500219;Oh, come now, Susan. He's clearly lying.
500220;We haven't got time to-
500221;Very well. Weasley, fetch the witness.
500222;Full name?
500223;Arabella Doreen Figg, resident of Little Whinging.
500224;So...what is your story?
500225;I was sitting on my porch when I saw the two Dementors gliding towards the two boys.
500226;What did the Dementors look like?
500227;Well, they were big and wore great, tattered cloaks.
500228;Anything else?
500229;I-I felt them. It was horrible...like I would never be happy again.
500230;Very well, you may go.
500231;Not very convincing.
500232;Oh, I disagree. She described their effects very completely.
500233;So two Dementors just happen to be in Little Whinging? I think not...
500234;Only if the Dementors are still taking their orders from only the Ministry these days. I believe you know my views on this, Cornelius.
500235;Yes, and they're nothing but bilge, Dumbledore.
500236;Excuse me, Dumbledore, but did you just accused the Ministry of Magic of ordering an attack on this boy?
500237;Dementors are irrelevant!
500238;Well, yes, if he's telling the truth!
500239;Very well, all for clearing the accused of charges?
500240;All opposed?
500241;Excellent.
500242;Harry, you've been let off! That's wonderful!
500243;You were tried by the full court?
500244;I think so, yeah.
500245;Er...is Percy mad at you?
500246;Ah...yes...I'm afraid we had a bit of a row. He, well, he sided with Fudge and the rest of us sided with Dumbledore, so Percy left.
500247;Well, well, if it isn't Patronus Potter.
500248;What are you doing here?
500249;Come now, Potter, I really don't think that private matters between the Minister and myself are any concern of yours.
500250;Shall we continue this in your
500251;Certainly.
500252;If he wanted to talk to the Minister, why down here?
500253;Dunno, Harry. Some things are just beyond comprehension.
500254;Settle down, you three!
500255;Sirius, we saw Fudge talking with Lucius Malfoy on Level Nine again. Tell Dumbledore, next time he comes in, would you?
500256;Yeah, absolutely.
500257;Well, I'd better be off. I've got a bewitched vomiting toilet to deal with.
500258;George, remember that concept. Vomiting Toilet.
500259;Right you are, Fred.
500260;Also, I'm covering for Tonks on guard duty later tonight, so I won't be back until late.
500261;Harry!
500262;You all right, Harry?
500263;Yeah...just...my scar...the pain is getting stronger.
500264;Harry, I've got something that might interest you.
500265;This was the original Order of the Phoenix. Found it while we were cleaning.
500266;"There's Mad-eye and Dumbledore, right next to Dedalus Diggle; Marlene McKinnon, she was killed two weeks after this was taken...;"
500267;"then there's Frank and Alice Longbottom, tortured into insanity by Death Eaters; Lupin, of course.."
500268;My parents.
500269;I miss them, Sirius...
500270;I know, Harry, I know. I miss them too.
500271;It's not fair that I got to spend so much time with them and you didn't...
500272;Why'd they have to die, Sirius, why?
500273;I know I'm not your father, Harry, but I'll always be there for you, if I can help it...
500274;Thanks.
500275;Kreacher, get out of here! Now!
500276;Oh, how the old Mistress would weep to see the traitor in her house...
500277;Who..who was that?
500278;Kreacher. He's been alone with the house for years, he's gone a bit funny.
500279;Harry, Ron and I, we've been named House Prefects! She hands Harry a letter.
500280;What about you, Harry?
500281;Are you sure? I would have thought you would get one!
500282;I'm sure. Nothing.
500283;So...congratulations Ron, Hermione...
500284;Come on, lets go back downstairs!
500285;Yes, do go enjoy yourselves.
500286;What is that?
500287;Yes it is, it's right there!
500288;I see them too, Harry.
500289;Er...you are?
500290;Luna. Luna Lovegood.
500291;Well, thanks Luna.
500292;Hagrid's cabin looks deserted.
500293;I hope he's all right...
500294;What if he were still on his...
500295;What if he's still on his mission from Dumbledore?
500296;Yeah, could be.
500297;I beg a few moments of your attention, as I have a few start of term announcements. Right off, our caretaker, the good Mr. Filch, has reminded me for what he says is the four-hundred and sixty-second time that he had an annually updated list of various banned items, usually introduced by our humour experts Fred and George Weasley...
500298;... which are posted in an extensive list on the door to Mr. Filch's door.
500299;Also, we have two staffing changes this year. Professor Grubby-Plank will be taking the post of Care of Magical Creatures post as Professor Hagrid is on...extended leave.
500300;Additionally, we have Professor Umbridge, who has kindly agreed to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts-—
500301;Hem, hem, Headmaster, if I could address the school?
500302;Thank you, Headmaster. Now, how are we all doing tonight? I thought I would just say a few words. I am here at the Ministry of Magic's bequest, under Educational Decree twenty-two, which states that if the Headmaster of Hogwarts is unable to fill any teaching post the Ministry shall select one for the position.
500303;So why didn't your mum want you to come back to Hogwarts, Seamus?
500304;What?
500305;Me mam didn't want me to come back to Hogwarts...
500306;Why?
500307;Well...because of you...
500308;What did I do?
500309;She...well, she figure's you're, well...you're lying about You-Know- Who and Dumbledore's a right nutter...
500310;Where'd she get that from?
500311;No one believes me, Hedwig. No one...
500312;I'm alone...
500313;Sorry, Professor...
500314;Hmm, let's see, five points from Gryffindor for coming in late.
500315;Now, as I was saying before Mr. Potter interrupted with his antics, your Defense Against the Dark Arts education has been rather fragmented and disjointed in your past classes, hasn't it?
500316;I will be following a pre-approved Ministry-prepared, theory-centered Defense lesson plan.
500317;Copy this down.
500318;Yes?
500319;I wanted to know something about your course aims.
500320;Well, they should be perfectly self- evident.
500321;But surely the whole point of Defense against the dark arts is practical application?
500322;Miss Granger, this class has been approved by Ministry experts. Are you a Ministry Expert?
500323;No, but-
500324;Then you have no business challenging those who are. We will be learning about spells in a safe, risk-free environment-
500325;But we've got O.W.L.s coming up! You expect us to do the spells with no practice?
500326;What good's theory in the real world?
500327;What about Lord Voldemort?
500328;Ten points from Gryffindor, Mr. Potter. Let me set the record straight.
500329;Some of you have been told that a certain dead wizard has returned. This is a lie.
500330;It-is-NOT-a-LIE!
500331;Mr. Potter, you have just landed yourself in detention!
500332;So, according to you, Cedric Diggory dropped dead? Or are you calling me a murderer?
500333;The boy's death was a tragic accident.
500334;It was MURDER! I saw it happen!
500335;Mr Potter, you have earned yourself a week's worth of detentions!
500336;Yeah, talk to somebody who cares.
500337;That goes to Professor McGonagall, dear.
500338;Yeah. But she called me a liar!
500339;Yes, Professor.
500340;Good. Off you go.
500341;How can Dumbledore let that horrible woman teach? And when we're taking our OWL tests too!
500342;You reckon she's here to spy on us?
500343;Well, not us specifically, but definitely Dumbledore and the Order.
500344;Oh! Sorry...
500345;Yeah, well, you're going to have to get out of it somehow. We're holding tryouts for Keeper now Wood's gone, and I wanted to have the whole team there.
500346;I'll never get out of it, Angelina.
500347;Well, just...don't do it again!
500348;Well, Harry, shall we start on Snape's report?
500349;Later, I've got detention.
500350;Good luck, Harry.
500351;Thanks.
500352;Ah, Potter. Sit down.
500353;You're going to be doing lines, tonight, Mr. Potter, and you'll be using this quill.
500354;"You will write ""I will not tell lies"" until I tell you to stop. Understand?"
500355;There's no ink.
500356;Oh...you won't need ink.
500357;Problem, Potter?
500358;That's enough for this evening. Same time, tomorrow, and we'll see if we can get the message to sink in a bit deeper.
500359;Hey, Harry.
500360;Have you seen Ron? I can't find him anywhere.
500361;No, I haven't.
500362;He's been acting fishy all week. He's up to something.
500363;That's enough for tonight, Potter. Let's see that hand.
500364;Harry! I tried out for Quidditch Keeper at the tryouts! I'm on the team!
500365;Harry--bloody hell!
500366;He's got to be taken to the hospital wing.
500367;You said she was making you do lines!
500368;She is. But the quill has some sort of spell on it. It uses blood for ink.
500369;That old hag! She's sick!
500370;No, I'm telling anyone.
500371;Harry, I really think you should tell--
500372;No!
500373;I don't need his help. I don't need anyone's help.
500374;Hagrid's still not back yet. I hope he's all right.
500375;I've asked Sirius about it.
500376;Harry, you can't write to him! Owls are being intercepted, it isn't safe.
500377;Don't worry, Hermione, I wrote it in code. Anyway, I figured I need to tell someone about Umbridge. My scar hurt again last night in detention.
500378;Always knew she was a bit fishy.
500379;You think she's working for You- Know-Who?
500380;Well, it's a possibility, isn't it?
500381;I suppose so. He could have her under the Imperious Curse, though it's unlikely. Dumbledore'd know.
500382;Yeah, but Dumbledore didn't have a choice, did he? She'd been sent here by the Ministry.
500383;Greetings my children. I sense even now that many of you have already made the transition into the beyond!
500384;Today we will be continuing our interpretation of prophetic dreams. Please divide into your groups and discuss your recent night time visions using the text as a guide.
500385;And how long have you been at this post?
500386;I understand you are the descendent of the famous Seer Cassandra Trelawney?
500387;I am.
500388;And you are the first since Cassandra to have the Second Sight?
500389;These things tend to skip...several...generations.
500390;Of course.
500391;Now, if you would kindly make a prediction for me?
500392;The Inner Eye does not See upon command!
500393;My dear boy, your dream diary, if you please!
500394;My dear boy! My poor boy! These dreams are evil portends!
500395;Yes, yes, oatmeal! Are you telling me you cannot see the signs? The foretelling of suffering and death?
500396;Er...
500397;Perhaps you are not as in the beyond as the others.
500398;Well, if that's the best you can do, Professor, I will be going.
500399;Where are we going, Hermione?
500400;There we are.
500401;"""The Hog's Head,"" Hermione?"
500402;Come on, I'll explain in a minute.
500403;Hermione, what's going on?
500404;These are some people I mentioned my Defense Against the Dark Arts idea with.
500405;You mean about us teaching ourselves?
500406;Hey, Harry.
500407;Hey, Neville.
500408;Uh...same to you, Luna.
500409;Hear, hear!
500410;Obviously, this will help us pass our O.W.L.s, but more importantly, it gives us the ability to protect ourselves from...Lord Voldemort. Several people jump or wince in fear at the name.
500411;That's the first time you've said his name.
500412;How do we know You-Know-Who's really back?
500413;Dumbledore believes he is.
500414;You mean Dumbledore believes him.
500415;That's true, but I think we're drifting from the purpose--
500416;It's okay, Hermione.
500417;I believe Voldemort's back because I fought him last year. Dumbledore's already told the school that. If you didn't believe him you won't believe anyone.
500418;Well...anyway...uh, I think that in order to learn properly we'll need a teacher.
500419;But we're all students. None of us has the experience to--
500420;Someone here does. Everyone looks at her. She is staring directly at Harry.
500421;Me?
500422;I for one would like to know why Potter's qualified and the rest of us aren't.
500423;One of the portraits said you'd killed a Basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets with that sword in Dumbledore's office.
500424;Uh...well, yeah, I did.
500425;Blimey, Harry...
500426;Wow...
500427;Can't forget that he saved the Sorcerer's Stone from You-Know-Who in his first year.
500428;And last year he got through the Triwizard Tournament!
500429;Not to mention you dueled with You- Know-Who all alone and he still couldn't kill you!
500430;And you fought off those dementors that attacked you this summer.
500431;So all in favor of taking lessons from Harry?
500432;Where are we going to meet?
500433;What about an unused classroom?
500434;That might work. I'll look into that.
500435;Ok, good.
500436;I think we should put our names down, so we know who was here.
500437;I don't know...if it were found...I mean, Umbridge wouldn't like what we're doing...
500438;Honestly, Ernie, do you think I'd just leave it lying around? Besides, its enchanted.
500439;Also, what should we call ourselves?
500440;What about the Anti-Unbridhe League?
500441;I think it should be Dumbledore's Army. There is excited agreement. Harry smiles at her.
500442;We'll let you know when we're going
500443;I think that went well.
500444;Yeah.
500445;And did you see Cho, Harry?
500446;Well, she couldn't keep her eyes off you, could she?!
500447;Harry, you won't believe...that Umbridge woman...this is too much!!
500448;What's she done now?
500449;Follow me.
500450;"""By order of the Hogwarts High Inquisitor: All student organizations, societies, teams, groups, and clubs are henceforth disbanded. Permission to reform must be approved by High Inquisitor Umbridge. No student organization can exist without the knowledge and approval of the High Inquisitor. Any student found to be a part of an illegal organization will be expelled immediately."""
500451;She refused to allow us to reform the Gryffindor team. We had to go to Dumbledore to get her to allow it.
500452;Not only that, but what about the
500453;This isn't a coincidence.
500454;She knows.
500455;She can't!
500456;Look, we don't know how many people could have overheard our meeting and told her.
500457;Or somebody at the meeting could have blabbed to her.
500458;No, they couldn't have. The parchment we all signed was enchanted, like I said. No one can betray the D.A. without us knowing.
500459;What would we do without you, Hermione?
500460;Hedwig!
500461;She's hurt!
500462;She doesn't look very good.
500463;Harry, you'd better take her to Professor Grubby-Plank. She'll know what to do.
500464;Potter!
500465;Where on earth are you going at this time of night?
500466;It's Hedwig. I think she's been attacked.
500467;What?
500468;Yes, I think you might be right, Potter. She looks at Harry.
500469;London.
500470;Well, give her to me. I'll run her
500471;There you are.
500472;Bear in mind, Potter, that channels of communication in and out of Hogwarts are being watched, won't you?
500473;Yes, Professor.
500474;Good. Now, off to bed.
500475;Mr. Harry Potter!
500476;Dobby! What are you doing here?
500477;Dobby is cleaning, sir.
500478;What is it, Dobby.
500479;Dobby...Dobby wishes he could help Harry Potter. Dobby has heard him muttering in his sleep.
500480;Don't worry about it, Dobby. But I don't think you can help me.
500481;Actually, there is something you can do, Dobby.
500482;I need a room where twenty-eight people can practice Defense Against the Dark Arts without the teachers knowing. Especially Professor Umbridge.
500483;Dobby knows of the perfect place, Harry Potter! It is the Room of Requirement, sir. You can only use the room in times of great need. Whatever you need will be there for you, Harry Potter.
500484;That's brilliant, Dobby!
500485;Dobby can show you now, if you wish, Harry Potter.
500486;Better not, Dobby. School is pretty intense right now. We'll do it ina few months, before the holidays.
500487;...and Slytherin is up forty to ten. Alica with the quaffle!
500488;Weasley is our King, Weasley is our King, He always lets the Quaffle in, Weasley is our King!
500489;Just ignore them, Ron!
500490;I should thank you, Weasley. You're definitely our best player!
500491;Harry, are you all right?
500492;Bet you loved that, Potter! Saved Weasley's neck, didn't you?
500493;I've never seen a worse Keeper! Maybe we should add some more verses to our little song. About his filthy mother!
500494;And his pathetic loser of a father too!
500495;But then, you like the Weasleys, don't you? How can you stand the stink? I guess it reminds you of your own dear mother!
500496;Impedimenta!
500497;Don't make me stupify you, Potter!
500498;My office. Now.
500499;In all my thirty-nine years at this school, I have never seen such a disgusting display.
500500;Malfoy provoked us.
500501;Of course he wanted to provoke you! He'd just lost!
500502;I cannot express in words the disappointment I feel right now.
500503;What is it, Dolores?
500504;I thought you might need some additional authority in dealing with these two.
500505;You thought wrong. Now kindly remove yourself from my office.
500506;Now, I don't care what Malfoy said. Your performance out there was shameful. Fifty points from Gryffindor, and I'm giving you both a week's worth of detentions.
500507;I hardly think that's an adequate punishment for this.
500508;Educational Decree Twenty-Five. It gives me, as High Inquisitor, the power to give punishments and privileges, and to alter those given out to students by other members of the staff.
500509;So, I think a life-long ban from playing quidditch should do the trick for both of these. Oh, and this one's twin as well. He was going to attack Malfoy as well.
500510;Ban us...for life.
500511;Yes, indeed, Mr. Potter.
500512;Ah, I'll take your brooms as well.
500513;Well, have a wonderful day.
500514;You've--!
500515;My hands are tied, Potter.
500516;I can't believe it...three players banned for life in one day...
500517;I'm going to resign.
500518;You can't!
500519;I'm horrible! I should never have joined.
500520;If you quit, we'll be out four players!
500521;This is the worst day of my life.
500522;I know something that could cheer you up.
500523;Hagrid's back!
500524;Hagrid, what happened to you?
500525;I've fine, I tell yeh!
500526;Come off it, Hagrid! We're not blind!
500527;Can' answer tha', I'm afraid. Top secret, that is. Business of the Order.
500528;We know you were looking for giants, Hagrid. Dumbledore said so last year.
500529;Oh. Well, yeah, I was, then. Went with Madame Maxime. Took us a month to get to their camp.
500530;A month?
500531;O' course! Can' do magic, not with the Ministry followin' us all the way. Plus, giants aren't fond o' wizards. Don' trust 'em.
500532;So what did you do when you found them?
500533;So...no giants are coming?
500534;Well, not righ' away. We brought our message, an' I expec' a fair few'll remember it afore teh end comes.
500535;Glad to see all of you could find this place all right.
500536;Hey, Harry, what is all this stuff?
500537;Loads of Defense Against the Dark Arts equipment. Hopefully we'll be able to get to all of it before the end of term.
500538;Oh please. Professor Lockhart taught us that in second year.
500539;Lockhart didn't teach as much as prune himself.
500540;Besides, it works. I used it against You-Know-Who last June. It saved my life.
500541;Right. Well, let's split into pairs and give it a go.
500542;Expelliarmus!
500543;Well done, Neville!
500544;Look here, you lot! Neville's really got the hang of this one.
500545;Expelliarmus!
500546;I did it! I did it!
500547;Never forget this spell, Neville. It could save your live some day.
500548;Okay, everyone. We've done a lot today, and I've seen some great improvement. That's it for now. We'll meet back here, same time next week!
500549;What's wrong with him?
500550;Get McGonagall! Go!
500551;Harry! HARRY!
500552;Potter!
500553;Wake up, Potter. Wake up. Please...
500554;Mr. Weasley's been attacked!
500555;You dreamed this, Potter?
500556;No, I saw it happen! I...I was there...
500557;You're sure this happened, Potter?
500558;We're going to see the Headmaster, Potter.
500559;Professor McGonagall, and...ah...
500560;What can I do for you?
500561;Well, Potter has had some kind of nightmare...
500562;How did you see this? How were you positioned when you saw it?
500563;Oh. Uh...I was the snake. I saw it from the snake's perspective.
500564;Is Arthur seriously injured?
500565;Yes!
500566;You were listening?
500567;Naturally.
500568;Raise the alarm. We must make sure Arthur is found by the right people.
500569;Many of our previous headmasters and mistresses have portraits in other institutions, allowing them to move between them.
500570;Fawkes, we will need a warning.
500571;Naturally, naturally.
500572;What news?
500573;I shouted until someone came. They carried him up seconds ago. He doesn't look good. Covered in blood...
500574;Dumbledore, I've just seen them arrive at St. Mungos. Apperated there moments ago. He looks really bad.
500575;Good.
500576;Minerva, the rest of the Weasleys will need to be awoken.
500577;Phineas.
500578;Phineas, I need you to visit your other portrait. Tell Sirius what happened and that we are coming to stay for a while.
500579;It's late, Dumbledore...
500580;I'm going, I'm going...
500581;Sit, Potter.
500582;As you are well aware, I will be teaching you Occlumency. The headmaster feels you should learn this form of magic to defend yourself against the Dark Lord, who is skilled at Legilimency.
500583;What's that, Professor?
500584;Legilimency is the ability to extract thoughts and feelings from others.
500585;Voldemort can read minds?
500586;As usual, you have all the subtlety of a stone wall, Potter.
500587;The mind is not a book, of which any page can be examined. The mind is complex and multi-layered.
500588;So he could read our minds right now?
500589;But hasn't it helped so far? I mean, it saved Mr. Weasley's life, didn't it?
500590;Yes, it did, but at the expense of our advantage. The connection between you was so powerful during your vision of the snake that the Dark Lord became aware of it. The Headmaster fears that he may try to use this to his advantage, to manipulate you through false visions.
500591;Wand out, Potter.
500592;You may use any spell you can think of to try and repel me.
500593;What are you going to do?
500594;I am going to break into your mind.
500595;No!
500596;Well, you stopped me eventually. Ideally, you should repel me with your mind.
500597;Clear your mind, Potter. Abandon
500598;Come on, Harry!
500599;I've been there before...
500600;What was that?
500601;I've just realized...
500602;Realized what, Potter?
500603;What's in the Department of Mysteries, sir?
500604;What did you say?
500605;That corridor, I've been dreaming about it for months...it leads to the Department of Mysteries, I'm sure of it.
500606;There are many things in the Department of Mysteries, Potter, none of which concern you.
500607;I can do whatever I wish!
500608;This is my home!
500609;Not anymore.
500610;Now remove yourself from this castle!
500611;I have the authority, Headmaster!
500612;Oh, I agree with you, Professor Umbridge. You do have the power to dismiss my teachers. However...
500613;-..-You cannot send them from this
500614;And what of her quarters when I appoint a new teacher.
500615;Happily, that will not be necessary. I have found a successor
500616;...the Ministry can only appoint new teachers if I cannot find one. I think you will find him suitable enough.
500617;This is Firenze.
500618;So you're saying this weapon You- Know-Who's after is in the Department of Mysteries?
500619;It's got to be.
500620;That's got to be what Surgis Podmore was doing in the Ministry when he was arrested.
500621;Probably. Mr. Weasley was probably there when he was attacked, too. That must be what the Order's guarding!
500622;But why the Department of Mysteries?
500623;It makes perfect sense, Ron. It's got to be something the Ministry's been developing. Something top secret.
500624;Look at this. There's been a mass escape from Azkaban.
500625;Bloody hell!
500626;They're all Death Eaters!
500627;Yes.
500628;Voldemort.
500629;Since I had received information some time ago that Potter and a number of other students had met in the Hog's Head to start an illegal group--
500630;I'm not sure that's true, Professor.
500631;I'm sorry?
500632;In point of fact, when young Potter met those students it was not illegal.
500633;But two days later, Educational Decree Twenty-Four was introduced.
500634;Again, quite correct. However, I wonder if you have any evidence that proves this group has been meeting since then?
500635;I have a witness right here!
500636;Correct again. I must confess that I was, however, under the impression that this young girl only told you a meeting was going on tonight.
500637;Let's ask her, shall we?
500638;You can shake your head for an
500639;What do you mean by shaking your head, girl?
500640;But what about Potter? He was the
500641;Why are you shaking your head, girl?
500642;Again, I cannot have you manhandling my students, Professor Umbridge.
500643;My apologies, Headmaster. I forgot myself.
500644;Well, what about the meeting tonight?
500645;So, Dumbledore, you've been behind this whole thing.
500646;Well, Minister. You've caught me.
500647;This has all been your doing! You've been recruiting students for your army!
500648;Quite correct, Cornelius.
500649;I knew it! I KNEW it! You've been plotting against me all this time!
500650;This is too good to be true!
500651;Professor, no!
500652;Quiet, Harry!
500653;Yes, shut up, Potter. So, you'll be coming with us to the Ministry--
500654;Ah, yes. I was wondering when we'd hit that little snag.
500655;I see no snag, Dumbledore.
500656;But I do. You seem to be laboring under the delusion that I would 'come quietly.'
500657;Resisting arrest, now are you, Dumbledore?
500658;You would really take on two Aurors, Dolores, and myself, Dumbledore?
500659;Naturally. All of you did rather well on your spellwork at this school, but if you attempt to take me in by force, I'm afraid I shall have to hurt you.
500660;Are you all right?
500661;Yes, we're fine.
500662;I'm not going into hiding. Fudge will soon regret removing me from Hogwarts.
500663;I'm so sorry, Professor!
500664;It's fine. Now listen to me, Harry. Keep studying Occlumency! Do everything Professor Snape tells you.
500665;Close your mind! You will understand, in time. Fudge is stirring.
500666;Lay back down. They must not think we have had time to talk.
500667;Find him!
500668;"""By Order of the Ministry of Magic: Dolores Jane Umbridge will replace Albus Dumbledore as Head of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry."""
500669;My first act as your new Headmistress is to form an Inquisitional Squad, lead by Draco Malfoy. They will report directly to me about the goings on in the halls of this school.
500670;Furthermore, our good caretaker, Mr. Filch has requested we reinstate the 'old punishments.' I have decided that there is no reason we shouldn't.
500671;Are you sure you can't? Hagrid said it was important.
500672;No way. Quidditch practice. If I don't show up, Angelina'll go mad.
500673;Hagrid...we've been walking for a good hour.
500674;Its jus' up ahead, here.
500675;Could you tell us what it is, Hagrid, please?
500676;All righ'. Well, I'm showin' yeh this, because tha' Umbridge woman put me on probation. I can' last much longer afore I get sacked like Trelawney.
500677;We won't let her!
500678;Of course we'll help.
500679;Knew yeh'd say yes!
500680;Okay, real quiet like from here on.
500681;There we are!
500682;Hagrid, I thought none of them wanted to come!
500683;None o' them did, Hermione! I didn' have much ruddy choice inna matter! I couldn' leave 'im!
500684;Oh, why, Hagrid? Why?
500685;He's me brother!
500686;Well, half-brother anyway. Me mum had 'im afore she died.
500687;Here. I'll introduce yeh to Grawp!
500688;Yeh all righ', Grawp?
500689;Look wha' I brough' yeh, Grawpy! Two new friends an' all. We 'ave Harry Potter here, see? An' over here is Hermy.
500690;Hermy!
500691;Bad Grawpy! Bad boy!
500692;We don' attack our friends, Grawpy!
500693;See, he don' know any better.
500694;Anyway, all yeh need teh do is go an' talk to 'im. Give 'ima bit o' company.
500695;Oh blimey...
500696;I thought we told you that you were no longer welcome in this place, Hagrid. You or that beast you brought from afar.
500697;S'not up to you who comes and goes in this forest.
500698;You stopped us from invoking our punishments on Firenze for becoming the servant of the humans at
500699;Stopped yeh from committin' murder, yeh mean!
500700;Well, you'll tolerate 'im as long as he's here!
500701;We allow you to pass this time, Hagrid, because you have young with you. But the next time you enter this forest, your life is forfeit.
500702;Have you been practicing, Potter?
500703;Yeah.
500704;Well, we shall see, won't we?
500705;Put that away, James.
500706;I'm bored. Wish it was full moon.
500707;Easy for you to say.
500708;This should cheer you up, Sirius. Look. Sirius grins.
500709;All right, there, Snivellus?
500710;Expelliarmus!
500711;Impedimenta!
500712;You just wait...
500713;And now, the moment you've all been waiting for--
500714;Leave him alone, James Potter!
500715;Another charity case, Lily?
500716;What has he done to you?
500717;Nothing. It's more the fact that he exists, you see...
500718;Semper-——
500719;Levicorpus!
500720;Leave him alone, Potter!
500721;I will if you go out with me.
500722;I wouldn't go out with you if it were a choice between you and the giant squid! Now let him down.
500723;Locomotor mortis!
500724;I said, leave him alone!
500725;Don't make me hex you, Lily.
500726;Then let him go!
500727;Fine!
500728;You're lucky Lily was here, Snivellus!
500729;I don't need help from a mud-blood like her!
500730;Apologize to her! Now!
500731;Don't make him apologize. Honestly, you're as bad as he is!
500732;I would never call you that.
500733;You make me sick, Potter.
500734;Lily! Hey Lily!
500735;Having fun, Potter?
500736;Been enjoying yourself?
500737;No!
500738;Amusing man, your father...
500739;I--sorry!
500740;You will repeat what you saw to no
500741;No, of course not!
500742;You had better not, Potter, or you will experience a pain so horrible you will wish you had never been born!
500743;Now get out of my sight! Do not set foot in this office ever again!
500744;Can you reach it? Can you take it for me, Black?
500745;I would rather die!
500746;Oh, you will die. Eventually. But there are hours, even days of pain awaiting you before then.
500747;I'm going to enjoy this, Black. I have you, and soon I shall have the weapon. And then not even your pathetic Order can stand in my way! Voldemort laughs, a horrible spine-chilling laugh.
500748;Are you all right, Potter?
500749;Pressure of exams. It happens. Take a breath, and maybe you'll be ready to go back in. Time is nearly up, but--—
500750;No--no, I've done all I can.
500751;You all right?
500752;Voldemort! He's got Sirius! In the Department of Mysteries!
500753;How do you know?
500754;I just saw it.
500755;How're we going to get there?
500756;To the Department of Mysteries?
500757;We've got to do something!
500758;How'd Voldemort get into the Ministry of Magic without being seen? I mean, he and Sirius are the two most wanted wizards in the world...
500759;Yeah. They can't just waltz into the Ministry of Magic!
500760;It just seems so unlikely, Harry!
500761;I won't let Sirius die!
500762;We heard Harry yelling. What's up?
500763;Voldemort's broken into the Department of Mysteries. He's got Sirius there!
500764;Think, Harry! Voldemort knows you! He knows you'd rush off to save Sirius.
500765;There isn't anyone else, Hermione! Everyone from the Order is gone!
500766;Anything we can do to help?
500767;No, there isn't!
500768;Yes, they can, Harry.
500769;How?
500770;Before we do anything, we need to establish that Sirius really isn't at Headquarters. Which means we'll need to break into Umbridge's office.
500771;Might be able to.
500772;Just give us a few seconds.
500773;Mind you, it's got to be really good!
500774;It's been too quiet around here
500775;Time we did some real damage to this place.
500776;We'll also need to keep everyone away from her office.
500777;We can do that! Me and Luna'll guard the hallway.
500778;We'll probably only manage five minutes or so.
500779;That's all we'll need.
500780;Right. You've got ten minutes to get to Umbridge's office. And whatever you do, stay away from the Astronomy Tower for the next couple of hours.
500781;Unless they spread, in which case, I'd get out of the castle for a while.
500782;Break out your Invisibility Cloak, Harry.
500783;Professor! It's those Weasley twins! They've set something off in the Astronomy Tower!
500784;Ready to try out the old punishments again?
500785;Grimmauld Place!
500786;That was worth it!
500787;I've got you now!
500788;Thank you for playing, one and all.
500789;And now, we've got to go!
500790;Sirius! Lupin? Hello?
500791;What's this? The Potter boy in the fire...
500792;Kreacher, where's Sirius?
500793;Master went out.
500794;So, turning a hallway into a swamp is funny, is it?
500795;Fairly amusing, yeah.
500796;Well, now you're going to learn what happens to wrongdoers in my school.
500797;This was never your school! Hogwarts is Dumbledore's school!
500798;Well, now you're going to get your
500799;You know, I don't think we are.
500800;George, I think we've outgrown full- time education. Wouldn't you agree?
500801;Completely, Fred.
500802;Time to enter the real world?
500803;Definitely.
500804;Accio brooms!
500805;Accio brooms!
500806;We won't be seeing you.
500807;Yeah, don't bother writing.
500808;Be sure to visit us at our new premises on Diagon Alley!
500809;You know where he is, don't you?
500810;Master does not tell Kreacher where he goes.
500811;Master will never return from the Department of Mysteries!
500812;You think you could simply walk into my office without me knowing about it? Foolish boy!
500813;Accio wand!
500814;Who were you trying to contact?
500815;It's none of your business.
500816;Draco, would you fetch Professor Snape, please?
500817;Very well, Potter. I have been patient enough with you.
500818;You wished to see me?
500819;I have just caught Potter trying to communicate with someone in my fire. I need some Veritaserum. Truth syrum.
500820;Well, it appears that I cannot help you. I have none.
500821;He's got Padfoot at the place it's hidden!
500822;Potter, if I want nonsense shouted at me, I shall inform you. He sweeps from the office. Umbridge is enraged.
500823;We've played nicely, Potter. You
500824;You could have saved me a lot of trouble if those Dementors I sent to your house had finished you off!
500825;You sent the Dementors?
500826;Of course I did! Someone had to act!
500827;No! Please, stop!
500828;Well, well.
500829;Hermione, no!
500830;We have to tell her, Harry...
500831;I would rather die!
500832;Shut up, Potter! Now talk, you silly girl! Who were you talking to?
500833;We were trying to find Professor Dumbledore. We had to tell him...
500834;Tell him?
500835;That it's ready. The weapon.
500836;You and Mr. Potter will take me to it.
500837;Much further, is it?
500838;Oh, yes. It's very well hidden.
500839;What are you doing in our forest?
500840;Your forest? This forest belongs to the Ministry of Magic!
500841;Stay back, you beasts!
500842;You cannot attack me! Any attack on a wizard by a half-breed--
500843;Don't call them that!
500844;You dare to insult us?
500845;Come no closer!
500846;Incarcerus!
500847;Ingrates! Animals! Filthy half- bloods!
500848;What of these two?
500849;They have been here with Hagrid. They have heard the warnings and disobeyed. They must suffer the consequences!
500850;God, I can't wait until all you Weasleys have been expelled. Your stench has been fouling this castle for too long.
500851;Shut up, Malfoy!
500852;That's for speaking to me. You know, you Weasleys are just as bad as Mudbloods!
500853;You know, Weasley, it's really too bad Potter saved you from the Chamber of Secrets.
500854;Stupify!
500855;Expelliarmus!
500856;Haggar!
500857;Hermy! Where Haggar?
500858;Grawp, help us!
500859;Grawp save Hermy!
500860;Great plan, Hermione.
500861;I thought it worked out rather nicely.
500862;That's just what we were wondering.
500863;So, how do we get to the Ministry?
500864;I'd imagine we should fly.
500865;We've got no brooms.
500866;There are other ways to fly.
500867;I mean, they can fly, and they're
500868;What are those?
500869;What are what?
500870;There's nothing there, Harry.
500871;Yes, there is. They're Thestrals. You can't see them unless you've seen someone die.
500872;I can see them too.
500873;All right, then. Get on one, and we'll be off.
500874;And what about those of us who can't see them? Luna comes over to them.
500875;I'll show you.
500876;Never again...
500877;What now, Harry?
500878;All right, come on.
500879;Department of Mysteries.
500880;Where is everyone?
500881;The Ministry closed a half-hour ago. I expect they all went home.
500882;That's how Voldemort got in unnoticed.
500883;This is it. Come on.
500884;Stay close.
500885;Now where?
500886;I don't understand. In my dream,
500887;Well, let's try a few.
500888;Yeah. I'll know the way when I see it.
500889;Who's there?
500890;Sirius?
500891;There's no one here, Harry. This isn't the right room.
500892;Does anyone else hear that?
500893;I do. It's coming from the Veil.
500894;There are people in there!
500895;What do you mean, people?
500896;Harry, I think we should leave.
500897;Sirius...yeah...
500898;Alohomora!
500899;Whatever's in there, the Ministry sure doesn't want anyone getting to it.
500900;This is it! Come on!
500901;This is it. This is where Sirius is!
500902;He's in here somewhere.
500903;I don't think Sirius is here.
500904;Harry, have you seen this?
500905;Er...it's got your name on it.
500906;What's my name doing here?
500907;Don't touch it, Harry!
500908;Why not?
500909;Yeah, Harry, don't.
500910;It's got my name on it!
500911;I warned you before that one day you would come to a sticky end, Potter.
500912;Where's Sirius?
500913;We don't have him, if that's what you mean. Harry is stunned.
500914;The Dark Lord knows your weakness for heroics, Potter. All it took was a little nudge to get you here.
500915;Now give me that prophesy.
500916;What prophesy?
500917;That prophesy. Now hand it over or we'll have to use wands on you.
500918;Go ahead.
500919;Very brave of you, Potter. Or are you foolish?
500920;Come and find out!
500921;Really, Potter. You expect to defeat all of us with your little school friends? Now hand it over, and they won't have to die here.
500922;I haven't escaped from Azkaban for this!
500923;No! If the prophesy is smashed--
500924;Take the youngest girl. We'll see how committed Potter is as we torture her.
500925;You even try to take her and I'll smash this thing.
500926;So, what kind of prophesy are we talking about here?
500927;Surely you jest, Potter?
500928;Not really. How come Voldemort wants it?
500929;You dare to speak the Dark Lord's name?
500930;Silence! How dare you utter that name from your half—-blood mouth!
500931;Hey, did you know Voldemort's a half-blood too?
500932;Control yourself, Bellatrix!
500933;What's so special about this
500934;You mean Dumbledore never told you the reason you bear that scar was hidden here?
500935;What?
500936;So that's what took you so long. We wondered.
500937;Only a person for whom the prophesy was made can remove it from its self, Potter, and the Dark Lord certainly couldn't get it himself.
500938;So he used me to do his dirty work, did he?
500939;Now!
500940;Stupify!
500941;Stop them!
500942;Colloportus!
500943;Where'd the rest go?
500944;Harry, they went the wrong way!
500945;They might have gone on to the hall.
500946;Check under the desks.
500947;Stupify!
500948;Avada-—
500949;Expelliarmus!
500950;Stupify!
500951;Ron!
500952;Impedimenta!
500953;We've got him!
500954;Silenco! Stupify!
500955;Pretificus Totalus!
500956;Stupify!
500957;Hermione!
500958;Please don't be dead, please don't be dead... He shakes her.
500959;What's they do to her?
500960;She's alive, Harry. There's a pulse.
500961;Can we carry her?
500962;I'll do it. You're better at fighting.
500963;Where do we go?
500964;I don't know...
500965;What happened.
500966;I think my ankle's broken. And somebody hit Ron with a weird spell...
500967;Hiyya, Harry.
500968;They hit her with something too.
500969;We need to get out of here. Luna, can you help Ginny?
500970;There they are!
500971;Your race is run, Potter. Hand it over.
500972;Let my friends go and I will.
500973;You are not in a position to negotiate.
500974;Don't do it, Harry! Don't!
500975;Stop, Neville!
500976;Neville? Neville Longbottom?
500977;My dear boy, I paid your parents a visit a long time ago. We had such a time!
500978;You put them in St. Mungos!
500979;So, Potter. Give us the Prophesy or I'll see how long it takes to crack Longbottom like his parents.
500980;Don't give it to them!
500981;Crucio!
500982;Are you all right?
500983;Yeah...
500984;Give me the prophesy!
500985;Get out of here, you two!
500986;That will take you back out of the Department of Mysteries.
500987;You come with us!
500988;You're the important one, now, Harry. I have to help the Order.
500989;I'll always be here for you, Harry. Now go!
500990;Hello, cousin!
500991;Potter!
500992;We may have lost the prophesy, but I can still deliver you to the Dark Lord!
500993;Stupify!
500994;Protego!
500995;It's Dumbledore!
500996;Is that the best you've got, cousin?
500997;Harry! HARRY!...he's gone...there's nothing you can do...
500998;No...no...no....
500999;Harry, no!
501000;You can't stop me, Potter!
501001;I'LL KILL you!!
501002;Stupify!
501003;Come out, come out, Potter...
501004;Well, well, have you come to avenge your dear Godfather?
501005;Crucio!
501006;Crucio!
501007;Never used an Unforgivable Curse before, have you, Potter? You have to mean it, you have to want to cause the pain in your very soul...
501008;Give me the prophesy!
501009;Can't. It got smashed by accident!
501010;You lie!
501011;How's Voldemort going to like that? You've failed him, and he's not very forgiving, is he?
501012;Forgive me, Master! I tried, I--
501013;He can't hear you from here, you know!
501014;So, you smashed my prophesy...
501015;I grow tired of you continually thwarting my plans, Harry Potter!
501016;Avada Kadavra!
501017;You should not have come here tonight, Tom.
501018;It is you who made that mistake, Dumbledore!
501019;Avada Kedavra!
501020;You do not seek to kill me, Dumbledore?
501021;There are other ways to destroy a man, Tom.
501022;There is nothing worse than death!
501023;You are quite wrong, Tom, as you have always been.
501024;Look out!
501025;Professor!
501026;Stay where you are, Harry!
501027;Harry!
501028;Are you all right, Harry?
501029;Minister, I saw him! You-Know-Who! He was right there!
501030;I know...I saw him too...
501031;If you and your men will proceed to the Death Room, you will find several Death Eaters which I and some others have apprehended.
501032;Seize him!
501033;Minister, you have just seen You- Know-Who in the flesh only seconds ago! It is time to come to your senses!
501034;If you insist on trying to arrest me, I am perfectly willing demonstrate how useless such an attempt will be.
501035;Dumbledore, what the blazes happened here?
501036;I will explain everything, Minister. Just as soon as I return Harry to school.
501037;What's he doing here? And what's happened to him?
501038;Minister, you will order the removal of Dolores Umbridge from my school.
501039;All Educational Decrees will be nullified and you will call off the search on Hagrid so he can return to work.
501040;I will return here later tonight, after I have seen to Harry. It should not take long. He taps the Golden centaur head.
501041;Portus.
501042;Dumbledore, I want some answers!
501043;The Second War has begun, Minister.
501044;Thank you...
501045;Please sit, Harry.
501046;I understand how you feel, Harry--
501047;No you don't!
501048;You forget that Sirius was my friend too. You are not the only person on this earth capable of feelings, Harry.
501049;There is no shame in feeling pain, Harry. It is your greatest strength...
501050;You don't have a clue! You can't possibly know!
501051;What can't I know?
501052;This pain is part of being human, Harry...
501053;I don't care! I don't care!
501054;You do care. You care so much you feel like you will bleed to death because of it.
501055;Let me out.
501056;No.
501057;You can't keep me in here!
501058;I daresay I can. And if you actually do attack me with that wand, Harry, I'm afraid to say you will regret it.
501059;It is my fault Sirius died tonight.
501060;Harry, I owe you this explanation, to show you the failings of an old man.
501061;I already know all this.
501062;Haven't you wondered why I haven't spoken to you, even looked at you, for months?
501063;Well, yeah, I did...
501064;Sirius told me you believed there was a snake inside of you. This was Voldemort attempting to manipulate you. To protect you from this, I had you study Occlumency.
501065;But Snape stopped giving me lessons.
501066;Yes. I thought he could overcome his feelings towards your father, but I was wrong. Some wounds cut too deep to be healed.
501067;He barely taught me, though. I always felt more open to it after the lessons. Like he was trying to open me to Voldemort—-
501068;I would trust Severus Snape with my life, Harry. You have never recovered from your mistrust of him in your first year.
501069;Sirius didn't trust him. Didn't believe he'd really turned to our side...
501070;Again, some wounds run too deep to be healed, Harry. Severus and Sirius never liked each other at school. This has never changed.
501071;During your Occulumency lessons, Professor Snape discovered that you were dreaming about the door in the Department of Mysteries.
501072;I've been dreaming about that all year, before Voldemort discovered the connection.
501073;Yes. Voldemort has been obsessed with hearing that prophesy since he returned. Because of your scar, what he was obsessed with, you were obsessed with, in the form of dreams.
501074;Once he discovered the connection, Voldemort had little difficulty in manipulating you into thinking he had captured Sirius.
501075;But I checked Grimmauld Place! Kreacher said--
501076;Kreacher lied. He wanted you to go to the Department of Mysteries.
501077;Why?
501078;Kreacher has been serving two masters for some months now.
501079;What?
501080;Wait, where was Sirius when I tried to contact him?
501081;Ah. Apparently Kreacher had injured Buckbeak to distract him in case you tried to contact Headquarters.
501082;Sirius was tending to the wounds when you called.
501083;And Hermione said we should be nice to Kreacher!
501084;She was quite right, Harry. Kreacher is what wizards have made him. He is to be pitied, not hated.
501085;Sirius hated him.
501086;He didn't hate Kreacher himself. Kreacher was a reminder to Sirius of the home he had always hated.
501087;Yeah, he really hated that place. And you kept him locked up in there!
501088;I was trying to save his life!
501089;I also knew that Voldemort would return one day. I played to his weakness. There is an ancient magic which Voldemort has always underestimated.
501090;This magic is what your mother gave you when she died. That protection would only work, however, if you were cared for by a blood relative. Your Aunt, Petunia.
501091;She never loved me.
501092;Perhaps not. But she took you in, however grudgingly. As long as you can call your Aunt's house your home, you are protected.
501093;And now we come to the moment of terrible truth, the moment I have dreaded for fifteen years. The moment when I must lay another burden atop your already straining shoulders.
501094;Do you remember your first year here? When you lay in the hospital wing fresh from your confrontation with Voldemort?
501095;Do you remember what you asked me that night?
501096;I asked you why Voldemort tried to kill me.
501097;You have no idea the pain it causes me to tell it to you, even now. But unfortunately, I must.
501098;I don't understand, Professor.
501099;Professor, why am I so important to
501100;An excellent question, Harry. The answer lies in the prophesy.
501101;Sir, it got smashed.
501102;That was not the only place the Prophesy is preserved.
501103;"""The One with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches....Born to"
501104;I'm not sure I understand all that, sir...
501105;And...it means me?
501106;Interestingly, there were two boys whom the prophesy could have been referring to. You and Neville Longbottom.
501107;So it's not necessarily me, sir?
501108;What if he chose wrong?
501109;Why didn't he wait? Why attack when we were babies?
501110;Voldemort had an informant listening to my meeting with Professor Trelawney. Fortunately he was discovered before he could hear the entire prophesy. Voldemort had to act immediately, he didn't know the rest of the prophesy. All he knew was that he had to destroy the child who would grow to be a threat to his power.
501111;But I don't have any special powers.
501112;There is a room in the Department of Mysteries which is kept locked at all times. It contains a force so wonderful and yet terrible that it is greater than death itself. It is that power which you have incredible amounts of and of which Voldemort has none.
501113;What is it, sir?
501114;"There is only the end of the prophesy which we haven't addressed. It states ""neither can live while the other survives."""
501115;It is the final burden which I must place on you, Harry.
501116;One of us has to kill the other...in the end.
501117;Yes.
501118;Hello, Harry.
501119;Hey, Nick.
501120;I--Well, Madam Pomfrey asked me to tell you that Hermione and Ron are out of the hospital wing.
501121;Oh. Thanks.
501122;Nick, I was wondering about something?
501123;I've been expecting this...
501124;Expecting what?
501125;A lot of people come to me when they've lost loved ones.
501126;I expect so...
501127;He's not coming back, Harry.
501128;Why?
501129;I'm sorry I couldn't be of more
501130;Harry!
501131;How are you?
501132;Good as new, mate.
501133;Better.
501134;Come on, let's go in to the feast.
501135;I've got something to tell you. Something important.
501136;But not right now. I'm not ready.
501137;Take your time, Harry. We'll be here when you are.
501138;Hello, Harry.
501139;It's the last night and I need to pack.
501140;Oh, people take my things and hide them.
501141;"I don't think they like me much. Some of them call me ""Loony"" Lovegood."
501142;Do you need any help looking?
501143;Oh no. It all turns up in the end.
501144;Sirius Black. Hermione said he was your Godfather.
501145;Yeah.
501146;My mother. I was nine.
501147;I'm sorry.
501148;It's okay. It's not like I'll never see her again.
501149;Isn't it?
501150;Don't tell me you didn't hear them. The voices beyond the Veil?
501151;They were just out of sight, that's all.
501152;Of course. Anyway, my mum always said the things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end. If not always in the way we expect. Think I'll just go have some pudding.
501153;I've been thinking about something Dumbledore said to me.
501154;What's that ?
501155;That even though we've got a fight ahead of us we've got one thing that Voldemort doesn't have.
501156;Yeah ?
501157;Something worth fighting for
