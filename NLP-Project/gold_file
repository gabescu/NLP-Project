Text =  The media routinely obscures the lines between terrorism and legitimate resistance, as the recent article by Daniel Okrent of The New York Times demonstrates .

Text =  ...

Text =  The decision to sidestep the obvious to satisfy the need to avoid confrontation does not bring peace, but only delays the eventual conflict as the predators of Hamas and Hezbollah exploit the inherent weakness of the internationals and the media.

1	Warren Buffett	PERSON
2	Bill	PERSON

Text =  It 's a move that really worries me; Buffett 's usual justification for keeping most of his money was that he was still compounding the value of his fortune at a pretty high rate, so any gifts now would mean significantly less money for the foundation later.
1	Buffett	PERSON

Text =  It 's a little hard to parse, but at this point his ostensible view is that the Gateses are very good money-redistributors, and he wants them to have the money as soon as possible.

Text =  Which essentially sounds like he 's worried that Bill or Melinda are going to die soon.
1	Bill	PERSON

Text =  I assume his actual reason is that he 's worried that Berkshire Hathaway just ca n't grow quickly enough to justify his usual charity policy.

Text =  I 'm not sure how the market will react.

Text =  It does n't change the company 's intrinsic worth, and as the article notes, the company might be added to a major index once the shares get more liquid.

Text =  On the other hand, this is essentially a statement that the company is overpriced from the guy who knows it best -- and happens to be the best investor of the last century.

Text =  em ... no ... the Gates foundation mainly invests in medical research and education, that means donating now adds a tremendous value compared to donating in ten years.

Text =  Because the 10.000.000 people dying from malaria will otherwise be dead.
1	malaria	GPE

Text =  i.e.

Text =  He 's not giving 85% away, he 's giving a number of shares each year that decrease in number at the rate of 5% a year (until gone?).

Text =  He mentions his wife 's death having an effect on him.

Text =  It sounds pretty rational that he 's saying that Bill and Melinda are at a prime spot, so starting the money hose now is a good idea, but Buffet is still keeping most of his donation inside of Berkshire where it will compound.

Text =  They know that the American advent implies for them a demotion, and an elevation of the Shiites and Kurds, and they refuse to go quietly.

Text =  See http://www.gulf-news.com/Articles/news.asp?ArticleID=97508

Text =  The September 11 Panel will issue its findings on Thursday.

Text =  It notes 10 points at which the US made key mistakes that might have stopped Bin Laden 's plot.
1	US	GPE
2	Bin Laden 's	PERSON

Text =  Four of these were under Clinton and 6 under Bush.
1	Clinton	PERSON
2	Bush	PERSON

Text =  Bush came out today and said that if he had known what was coming, he would have expended every effort to stop it, and that so would have Clinton.
1	Bush	PERSON
2	Clinton	PERSON

Text =  This statement is, despite its facade of fair-mindedness, so many weasel words.

Text =  Of course Bush would have tried to stop 9/11 if he had known it was coming.
1	Bush	PERSON

Text =  The question is, "Should he have known it was coming?"

Text =  The answer is, "Yes!"

Text =  We now know that Bush and his administration came into office obsessed with Iraq.
1	Bush	PERSON
2	Iraq	GPE

Text =  Cheney was looking at maps of Iraq oil fields and muttering about opportunities for US companies there, already in January or February of 2001.
1	Cheney	PERSON
2	Iraq	GPE
3	US	GPE

Text =  Wolfowitz contradicted counter-terrorism czar Richard Clarke when the latter spoke of the al-Qaeda threat, insisting that the preeminent threat of terrorism against the US came from Iraq, and indicating he accepted Laurie Mylroie 's crackpot conspiracy theory that Saddam was behind the 1993 World Trade Towers bombing.
1	Wolfowitz	PERSON
2	Richard Clarke	PERSON
3	US	GPE
4	Iraq	GPE
5	Laurie Mylroie 's	PERSON
6	Saddam	PERSON

Text =  If you believe crackpot theories instead of focusing on the reality--that was an al-Qaeda operation mainly carried out by al-Gamaa al-Islamiyyah, an Egyptian terrorist component allied with Bin Laden-- then you will concentrate on the wrong threat.
1	al-Gamaa al-Islamiyyah	PERSON
2	Bin Laden--	PERSON

Text =  Even after the attacks on September 11, Bush was obsessing about Iraq.
1	Bush	PERSON
2	Iraq	GPE

Text =  Wolfowitz lied to him and said that there was a 10 to 50% chance that Iraq was behind them.
1	Wolfowitz	PERSON
2	Iraq	GPE

Text =  (On what evidence?

Text =  The hijackers were obviously al-Qaeda, and no operational links between al-Qaeda and Iraq had ever been found).
1	Iraq	GPE

Text =  Rumsfeld initially rejected an attack on al-Qaeda bases in Afghanistan, saying there were "no good targets" in Afghanistan.
1	Rumsfeld	PERSON
2	Afghanistan	GPE
3	Afghanistan	GPE

Text =  (What about 40 al-Qaeda bases that had trained the 9/11 hijackers and other terrorists gunning for the United States??)
1	the United States	GPE

Text =  The Pentagon did not even have a plan for dealing with Afghanistan or al-Qaeda that it could pull off the shelf, according to Bob Woodward.
1	Afghanistan	GPE
2	Bob Woodward	PERSON

Text =  Bush did not have his eye on the ball.
1	Bush	PERSON

Text =  Neither did Cheney, Rumsfeld, or Wolfowitz.
1	Cheney	PERSON
2	Rumsfeld	PERSON
3	Wolfowitz	PERSON

Text =  They were playing Captain Ahab to Saddam 's great white whale.
1	Ahab	PERSON
2	Saddam	PERSON

Text =  Imperial Hubris makes the case that lots of people in the CIA and counter-terrorism divisions elsewhere in the US government knew all about Bin Laden and the threat he posed.
1	US	GPE
2	Bin Laden	PERSON

Text =  They were from all accounts marginalized and not listened to.

Text =  Bush demoted Dick Clarke, among the most vocal and focused of the al-Qaeda experts, from his cabinet.
1	Bush	PERSON
2	Dick Clarke	PERSON

Text =  Dick could never thereafter get any real cooperation from the cabinet officers, who outranked him, and he could not convince them to go to battle stations in the summer of 2001 when George Tenet 's hair was "on fire" about the excited chatter the CIA was picking up from radical Islamist terrorists.
1	Dick	PERSON
2	George Tenet 's	PERSON

Text =  As for the Clinton administration, let me say one thing in its defense.
1	Clinton	PERSON

Text =  Clinton had worked out a deal with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in summer of 1999 that would have allowed the US to send a Special Ops team in after Bin Laden in Qandahar, based from Pakistan.
1	Clinton	PERSON
2	Nawaz Sharif	PERSON
3	US	GPE
4	Bin Laden	PERSON
5	Qandahar	GPE
6	Pakistan	GPE

Text =  I presume you need the Pakistan base for rescue operations in case anything went wrong.
1	Pakistan	GPE

Text =  You also need Pakistani air space.

Text =  The plan was all set and could have succeeded.

Text =  But in fall of 1999, Gen. Pervez Musharraf made a coup against Nawaz Sharif.
1	Pervez Musharraf	PERSON

Text =  The Pakistani army was rife with elements protective of the Taliban, and the new military government reneged on the deal.

Text =  Musharraf told Clinton he could n't use Pakistani soil or air space to send the team in against Bin Laden.
1	Musharraf	PERSON
2	Clinton	PERSON
3	Bin Laden	PERSON

Text =  Look at a map and you try to figure out how, in fall of 1999, you could possibly pull off such an operation without Pakistani facilities.

Text =  Of course, you could just go in by main force.

Text =  But for those of you tempted in that direction, please look up Carter 's Tabas operation.
1	Carter	PERSON

Text =  It should be easily googled.

Text =  Clinton tried, and tried hard.
1	Clinton	PERSON

Text =  The gods were n't with us on that one.

Text =  On the internet site of Monotheism and Holy War (al-Tawhid wa al-Jihad) , the group allegedly declared, "We announce that the Tawhid and Jihad Group, its prince and soldiers, have pledged allegiance to the sheikh of the mujahideen Osama bin Laden."
1	al-Tawhid	PERSON
2	Osama bin Laden	PERSON

Text =  This pledge is a new development.

Text =  Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and his group are said to have been bitter rivals of al-Qaeda during the Afghan resistance days.
1	Abu Musab al-Zarqawi	PERSON

Text =  One witness at the Moutasaddiq trial in Germany alleged that Zarqawi had not allowed Monotheism and Holy War to share resources with al-Qaeda in the early zeroes of the 21st century.
1	Germany	GPE
2	Zarqawi	PERSON

Text =  If the statement is true, it is a worrying sign that even the divided small radical guerrilla groups are being "picked up" by al-Qaeda.

Text =  This consolidation is obviously a result of Bush 's aggressive invasion of Iraq and of the botching of the aftermath.
1	Bush	PERSON
2	Iraq	GPE

Text =  It is a setback for the war on terror.

Text =  Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan was a group of only a few hundred "Afghan Arabs" who pledged personal loyalty to Usamah Bin Laden.
1	Afghanistan	GPE
2	Usamah Bin Laden	PERSON

Text =  It could notionally be expanded to encompass the 5,000-strong "55th Brigade" of the Taliban regime, though this is not the technical definition.

Text =  Because Usamah is Saudi, my guess is that they were especially influenced by an extremist form of the Wahhabi school of Islam that predominates among Saudia 's some 15 million citizens.
1	Wahhabi	PERSON

Text =  In 1998 they were joined by Egyptians from the al-Jihad al-Islami group of Ayman al-Zawahiri (many of these were from Upper Egypt, especially Asyut and environs).
1	Ayman al-Zawahiri	PERSON
2	Upper	GPE
3	Egypt	GPE

Text =  After that point, al-Qaeda was a joint enterprise between the Egyptian extremists and the polyglot Arabs around Bin Laden, only some of whom were Saudi.
1	Bin Laden	PERSON

Text =  Zarqawi is a Jordanian, and his Monotheism and Holy War group in Afghanistan probably had a distinctive coloration as mainly Jordanian, Palestinian and Syrian.
1	Zarqawi	PERSON
2	Afghanistan	GPE

Text =  They also had a special connection to some extremists in Jordan and Germany.
1	Jordan	GPE
2	Germany	GPE

Text =  They are probably especially oriented toward the Salafi school of modern Islamic thought, which has a Protestant-like emphasis on going back to the original practice of the early companions of the Prophet Muhammad.
1	Salafi	PERSON

Text =  (Most Salafis are not militant or violent, though they tend to be rather narrow-minded in my experience, on the order of Protestant Pietists).

Text =  Monotheism and Holy War obviously does have a violent interpretation of Salafism, rather as the the leaders of the so-called German Peasant Rebellion among early Protestants did.

Text =  Another worrisome sign is that local Iraqi Sunni fundamentalists opposed to the US presence in Iraq have begun joining Monotheism and Holy War, and wearing its distinctive orange and black insignia.
1	US	GPE
2	Iraq	GPE

Text =  These have been sighted among Iraqi crowds on Haifa Street in Baghdad and in Samarra.
1	Baghdad	GPE

Text =  So now there are hundreds of al-Qaeda members in Iraq where there had been none before.
1	Iraq	GPE

Text =  The consolidation of smaller local radical fundamentalist groups with al-Qaeda can also be seen in the case of the Fizazi group in Tangiers that morphed into the Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group , had members who met with September 11 ringleader Muhammad Atta, and ultimately was in part responsible for the Madrid train bombings.
1	Fizazi	PERSON
2	Tangiers	PERSON
3	Muhammad Atta	PERSON
4	Madrid	GPE

Text =  The Iraqi Islamic Party lead by Muhsin Abdul Hamid, has been among the few Sunni Muslim groups willing to cooperate (even if rather lukewarmly) with the Americans.
1	Muhsin Abdul Hamid	PERSON

Text =  It is now threatening to pull out of the Allawi caretaker government.
1	Allawi	PERSON

Text =  The IIP had also been the main force urging Sunni Arabs to participate in the elections scheduled for January, and had been opposed in this stance by the Association of Muslim Scholars.

Text =  That the Iraqi Islamic Party is now contemplating leaving the Allawi government raises the question of whether a mass Sunni Arab boycott of the elections is in the offing, thus fatally weakening the legitimacy of any new government.
1	Allawi	PERSON

Text =  Az-Zaman : The Association of Muslim Scholars forbade Iraqis to participate in the attack on Fallujah with the Americans.
1	Az-Zaman	PERSON
2	Fallujah	GPE

Text =  In a communique, the AMS said that for Iraqis to take part with "raiding forces" in the assault on a city, the population of which is Muslim (such as Fallujah) would be considered the most mortal of mortal sins.
1	Fallujah	GPE

Text =  The Sunni AMS told Iraqis, "You sinned when you participated with occupation forces in the assault on Najaf, and beware lest you repeat this same sin in Fallujah.
1	Najaf	GPE
2	Fallujah	GPE

Text =  Remember that the Occupation is emphemeral."

Text =  The radical Shiite Sadr movement issued a statement forbidding the participation of Iraqi troops in the attack on Fallujah, as well.
1	Sadr	PERSON
2	Fallujah	GPE

Text =  The statement said, "We direct an appeal at the men in the Iraqi forces, whether national guards or others, the majority of whom are Muslim, calling upon them to refrain for commiting this enormous sin under the banner of forces that do not respect our religion or any principles of basic humanity, and we ask them to view this war as illegal."

Text =  It called a "ploy" the assertaion that the attack was merely on foreign fighters at Fallujah.
1	Fallujah	GPE

Text =  The convergence of views among the more militant Sunni Muslim clerics of AMS and the radical Shiites of the Sadr movement has been seen before, last spring during the initial US assault on Fallujah and during the US attack on Mahdi Army militiamen in Najaf.
1	Sadr	PERSON
2	US	GPE
3	Fallujah	GPE
4	US	GPE
5	Najaf	GPE

Text =  Most Shiites, however, are still reluctant to take major risks to support the Sunnis of Fallujah, many of whom had supported Saddam and his anti-Shiite pogroms.
1	Fallujah	GPE
2	Saddam	PERSON
