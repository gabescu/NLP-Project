600001;Narcissa!
600002;Cissy! You mustn't do this.  He can't be trusted.
600003;The Dark Lord trusts him.
600004;The Dark Lord is mistaken.
600005;Or so I believe.
600006;Well, who can one trust these days?
600007;He lives in this Muggle dunghill?
600008;Run along, Wormtail.
600009;I've nowhere else to turn, Severus.
600010;You must be joking.
600011;I know I ought not to be here. The Dark Lord himself has forbidden me to speak of this --
600012;If the Dark Lord has forbidden it, you ought not to speak.
600013;Put it down, Bella.  We mustn't touch what isn't ours. As it so happens I'm aware of your situation, Narcissa.
600014;You? The Dark Lord told you?
600015;Your sister doubts me, Narcissa. Understandable.
600016;Over the years I have played my part well.  So well I've deceived one of the greatest wizards of all time.
600017;Dumbledore is a great wizard. Only a fool would question it.
600018;I... I don't doubt you, Severus.
600019;You should feel honored, Cissy. As should Draco --
600020;He's just a boy!
600021;I can't change the Dark Lord's mind.  But it might be possible for me to help Draco.  To provide some... protection.
600022;Do you mean it, Severus?
600023;I can try.
600024;Oh, Severus, please, if you would... I would be forever in your debt.
600025;Swear to it.
600026;Make the Unbreakable Vow. You see.  It's just empty words. Oh he'll try.  He'll give it his best effort.  But when it matters most he'll slither back into his hole.  Bloody coward...
600027;Take out your wand.
600028;Will you, Severus Snape, watch over Draco Malfoy as he attempts to fulfill the Dark Lord's wishes.
600029;I will.
600030;And will you, to the best of your ability, protect him from harm?
600031;I will.
600032;And should it prove necessary, if it seems Draco will fail... will you yourself carry out the deed that the Dark Lord has ordered Draco to perform?
600033;I will.
600034;Harry Potter.  Who's Harry Potter?
600035;Oh.  Um.  No one.  Bit of a tosser.
600036;Funny that paper of yours.  Couple nights ago, I could swear I saw one of the pictures move.
600037;Really.
600038;Thought I'd gone round the twist.
600039;Hey.  I was wondering...
600040;Eleven.  That's when I get off.
600041;I once knew a Muggle girl from Liverpool with hair like spun silk.  No light could resist it...
600042;I like riding round on the trains. It takes my mind off... things.
600043;Rather unpleasant to behold, isn't it?  The tale is thrilling if I do say so myself, but I'm afraid now is not the time to tell it.  Take my arm.
600044;I just Apparated, didn't I?
600045;Indeed.  And quite successfully I might add.  Most people vomit their first time.
600046;Can't imagine why...
600047;Welcome to the charming village of Budleigh Babberton, Harry.  I assume right about now you're wondering why I've brought you here, am I right?
600048;After all these years, I just sort of roll with it, sir.
600049;Wand out, Harry.
600050;Lumos...
600051;Horace!
600052;Merlin's Beard!
600053;There's no need to disfigure me, Albus!
600054;I must say, you make a very convincing armchair, Horace.
600055;It's all in the upholstery. I come by the stuffing naturally. What gave me away?
600056;Dragon's blood.
600057;Yes, well, I couldn't very well use wizard's blood, could I?  Oho!
600058;Ah yes.  Introductions.  Harry, this is an old friend and colleague of mine, Horace Slughorn.  Horace, this is, well, you know who this is. Apparently there's some thought he may be the Chosen One.
600059;So why all the theatrics, Horace? You weren't perhaps expecting someone else, were you?
600060;S-someone else?  I'm sure I don't know what you mean.
600061;Oh all right!  The Death Eaters have been trying to recruit me for over a year.  Do you know what that's like?  One can only say no to these people so many times before they...
600062;Take matters into their own hands?
600063;I never stay anywhere more than a week.  The Muggles who own this place are in the Canary Islands.
600064;Well, I think it should be put back in order for them, don't you? Mind?
600065;That was fun.  May I use the loo?
600066;Don't think I don't know why you're here, Albus!  The answer is still no!  Absolutely, unequivocally no!
600067;You look very like your father. Except for your eyes.  You've got --
600068;My mother's eyes, yeah.
600069;Lily.  Lovely Lily.  She was exceedingly bright -- your mother. Even more impressive when one considers she was Muggle-born.
600070;One of my best friends is Muggle- born.  She's the best in our year.
600071;Oh, but you mustn't think I'm prejudiced!  No, no, no! Your mother was one of my absolute favorites!  Look, there she is. Right up front.
600072;All mine, each and every one.  Ex- students, I mean.  You recognize Barnubas Cuffe, of course, editor of the Daily Prophet.
600073;Always takes my owl should I want to register my opinion on the news of the day.  And there's Ambrosius Flume of Honeydukes.  Sends a hamper of chocolate to the house each birthday.  That is, when I had a house.  And Gwenog Jones, captain of the Holyhead Harpies -- free tickets whenever I want them. Of course, I haven't been to a match in some time...
600074;Ah yes.  Regulus Black.  You no doubt know of his older brother Sirius.  Died a few weeks ago.  I taught the whole Black family except Sirius.  Shame.  Talented boy.  I got Regulus when he came along, of course, but I'd have liked the set.
600075;Mind if I take this?  I do love knitting patterns.
600076;Of course.  But you're not leaving?
600077;I think I know a lost cause when I see one.  Regrettable.  I would have considered it a personal triumph had you consented to return to Hogwarts, Horace.  You are, like my friend Mr. Potter -- one of a kind.
600078;All right!  I'll do it.  But I'll be wanting Professor Merrythought's old office, not that water closet I had formerly. And I expect a raise!  These are mad times we live in!  Mad!
600079;Indeed they are.
600080;Sir, exactly what was that all --
600081;You are talented, famous and powerful -- everything Horace values.  Professor Slughorn is going to try to collect you, Harry.  You would be his crowning jewel.  That is why he is returning to Hogwarts.  And it is crucial he return...
600082;I fear I may have stolen a wondrous night from you, Harry. She was, truthfully, very pretty. The girl.
600083;It's alright, sir.  I'll go back tomorrow, make some excuse --
600084;You'll not be going back to Little Whinging tonight, Harry.
600085;But, sir.  What about Hedwig?  And there's my trunk --
600086;Both are waiting for you.
600087;Sir?
600088;Hedwig...?  Mum!
600089;Exactly.  How'd you guess?
600090;I'm joking, Mum.
600091;You're worse than Fred and George.
600092;Now you're joking.  I was only wondering when Harry got here.
600093;Harry who?
600094;Harry Dimpleton.  Harry Potter, of course.
600095;I think I'd know if Harry Potter was in my house, wouldn't I?
600096;Well his trunk's in the kitchen. And his owl.
600097;I seriously doubt that.
600098;Harry?  Did someone say Harry?
600099;Me, nosy.  Is he up there with you?
600100;'Course not.  Think I'd know if my best friend was in my room, wouldn't I?
600101;Was that an owl I heard?
600102;Harry's.  Haven't seen him, have you?  Apparently, he's wandering about the house.
600103;Really?
600104;Really.
600105;Harry!
600106;Harry!
600107;But why didn't you tell us you were coming?
600108;Didn't know. Dumbledore.
600109;That man.  But then, what would we do without him?  Ron!
600110;You've a bit of...
600111;When'd you get here?
600112;A few days ago.  Though... for a bit, I wasn't sure I was coming.
600113;Mum sort of lost it last week. Said Ginny and I had no business going back to Hogwarts.  That it's too dangerous.
600114;Oh come on...
600115;She's not alone.  Even my parents -- and they're Muggles -- know something bad is happening.
600116;Anyway, Dad stepped in, told her she was being barmy.  Took a day or two, but she came round.
600117;But we're talking about Hogwarts. Dumbledore. What could be safer?
600118;There's been a lot of chatter lately.  That he's gotten... old.
600119;Rubbish.  He's only -- what?
600120;A hundred and fifty.  Give or take a few years.
600121;Step up!  Step up!
600122;Step up!  Step up!
600123;We've got Fainting Fancy...
600124;Nosebleed Nougats...
600125;And just in time for school...
600126;Puking Pastilles!
600127;Into the cauldron, handsome.
600128;Into the cauldron, handsome.
600129;What'd you think, Harry?
600130;Amazing.
600131;Pocket that and you'll pay in more than Galleons, my friend.
600132;We've got eyes in the back of our heads.
600133;Bloody urchins.
600134;Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder?
600135;A real money spinner that.
600136;Handy if you need to make a quick escape.  Hello, ladies!
600137;Yes, they do really work.
600138;Then again, the way we hear it, sis, you're doing just fine on your own.
600139;Meaning?
600140;Are you not currently dating Dean Thomas?
600141;None of your business.
600142;These are adorable.
600143;Aren't they now.  Pygmy Puffs. Can't breed them fast enough.
600144;How much for this?
600145;Five Galleons.
600146;Five Galleons.
600147;How much for me?
600148;Five Galleons.
600149;Five Galleons.
600150;But I'm your brother!
600151;Ten Galleons.
600152;C'mon. Let's go.
600153;Hi, Ron.
600154;Hi.
600155;How is it Fred and George are doing it?  Half the alley's closed down.
600156;Fred reckons people need a laugh these days.
600157;Reckon he's right...
600158;Oh no.  Look.
600159;But everyone got their wands from Ollivander.  Young.  Old...
600160;Good.  Bad.  Speaking of which...
600161;Is it just me?  Or do Draco and mummy look like two people who don't want to be followed?
600162;What're they playing at?
600163;Dunno.  Let's get closer.
600164;Hey.  Where's Hermione?
600165;Harry, where is she?
600166;I don't know.  I'm turned around.
600167;Bloody hell.
600168;Sorry.
600169;What just happened?
600170;I don't know.
600171;Quibbler...?  Quibbler...?
600172;There's an article on Wrackspurts this month.  Quibbler...?
600173;He's lovely.  They've been known to sing on Boxing Day, you know. Quibbler?
600174;Please.  What's a Wrackspurt?
600175;They're invisible creatures that float in through your ears and make your brain go fuzzy. Quibbler?  Quibbler?
600176;Don't you see, it was a ceremony. An initiation.
600177;Stop, Harry, I know where you're going with this --
600178;It's happened.  He's one of them.
600179;One of what?
600180;Harry is under the impression that Draco Malfoy is now a Death Eater.
600181;You're barking.  What would You- Know-Who want with a sod like Malfoy?
600182;So what's he doing in Borgin and Burke's?  Browsing for furniture?
600183;It's a creepy shop.  He's a creepy bloke.
600184;Look.  His father's a Death Eater. It only makes sense.  Besides, Hermione saw it.  With her own eyes.
600185;I told you.  I don't know what I saw.
600186;I need some air.
600187;What just happened?  Blaise?
600188;Don't know.
600189;Relax, boys.  The lights went out is all.  Come, Draco.  We'll be at Hogwarts before you know it.
600190;Hogwarts.  What a pathetic excuse for a school.  I think I'd pitch myself off the Astronomy Tower if I thought I had to continue on for another two years.
600191;What's that supposed to mean?
600192;Let's just say I don't think you'll be seeing me wasting my time in Charms Class next year.
600193;Amused, Blaise?  We'll see just who's laughing in the end.
600194;Where's Harry?
600195;Probably on the platform.  C'mon.
600196;You two go on.  I want to check something.
600197;Didn't mummy ever tell you it's bad manners to eavesdrop, Potter? Petrificus Totalus!
600198;Oh, right, she was dead before you could wipe the drool off your chin.
600199;Enjoy the ride back to London.
600200;Hello, Harry.
600201;Luna.  How'd you...?
600202;Wrackspurts. Your head's full of them.
600203;Sorry I made you miss the carriages, Luna.
600204;It's alright.  I enjoyed our walk. It was like being with a friend.
600205;I am your friend, Luna.
600206;That's nice.
600207;About time!  I've been looking all over for you two.  Names.
600208;Professor Flitwick, you've known me for five years.
600209;No exceptions, Potter.
600210;Who are those people?
600211;Aurors. For security.
600212;It's a not a cane, you cretin. It's a walking stick.
600213;And what exactly would you be wanting with a walking stick?
600214;It was his father's.
600215;Is my father's.  He's not dead.
600216;It's alright, Mr. Filch.  I can vouch for Mr. Malfoy.
600217;Nice face, Potter.
600218;Would you like me to fix it? Personally I think you look a bit more devil-may-care this way.  But it's up to you.
600219;Have you ever fixed one?  A nose.
600220;No.  But I've done several toes and how different are they really?
600221;What the hell.  Give it a go.
600222;Episkey.
600223;Well?  How do I look?
600224;Exceptionally ordinary.
600225;Brilliant.
600226;Don' you worry.  He'll be 'long soon 'nuff --
600227;Will.  You.  Stop.  Eating!  Your best friend is missing!
600228;Oi!  Turn around, you lunatic.
600229;He's covered in blood again.  Why is it he's always covered in blood?
600230;Looks like his own this time.
600231;Where've you been, Harry?  And what happened to your face?
600232;Later.  What've I missed?
600233;Sorting Hat urged us all to be brave and strong in these troubled times -- easy for it to say -- it's a hat, isn't it?  First Years seemed to enjoy it, though. Wankers. Filch give you the wand outside?
600234;Thanks...
600235;What's happened to his hand?
600236;The very best of evenings to you! First off, please join me in welcoming the newest member of our staff, Horace Slughorn.
600237;Professor Slughorn, I'm happy to say, has agreed to resume his old post of Potions master.  Meanwhile the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts will be assumed by Professor Snape.
600238;Now, as you know, each and every one of you was searched upon your arrival tonight.  You have a right to know why.
600239;Once there was a young man who, like you, sat in this very Hall. Walked this castle's corridors. Slept beneath its roof.  He seemed, to all the world, a student like any other.  His name? Tom Riddle. The Hall goes utterly silent.
600240;Today, of course, the world knows him by another name.  Which is why, as I stand looking out upon you all tonight, I am reminded of a sobering fact.  Each day, every hour, this very minute perhaps, dark forces attempt to penetrate this castle.  But in the end, their greatest weapon remains... you.
600241;Just something to keep in mind. Now, off to bed.  Pip pip!
600242;That was cheerful.
600243;History of Magic is up, ladies, not down.  Mr. Davies -- that's the girl's toilet...
600244;Potter!
600245;This can't be good.
600246;Enjoying ourself, are we?
600247;Well, you see, I've got an open period this morning, Professor --
600248;So I noticed.  I would think you'd want to fill it with Potions.  Or is it no longer your ambition to become an Auror?
600249;It is.  Or was.  But I was told I had to get an Outstanding in my
600250;And so you did when Professor Snape was teaching Potions. However, Professor Slughorn is perfectly happy to accept N.E.W.T. students with 'Exceeds Expectations.'
600251;Really?  Well... brilliant.  I'll head there straight away.
600252;Good.  And take Weasley with you. He looks far too happy over there.
600253;But I don't want to take Potions!
600254;Harry m'boy!  I was beginning to worry!  And I see we've brought someone with us...
600255;Ron Weasley, sir.  But I'm dead awful at Potions, a menace actually, so I probably should just be going --
600256;Nonsense, we'll sort you out.  Any friend of Harry's is a friend of mine.  Right then, books out --
600257;Um, sorry, sir, but I haven't got my book yet -- nor's Ron.  You see --
600258;Not to worry.  You can get what you need from the cupboard.
600259;Now, as I was saying, I've prepared a few concoctions this morning.  Any ideas what these might be?  Yes, Miss...?
600260;Granger, sir.  That one there is Veritaserum.  And that would be Polyjuice Potion.  And that is Amortentia! The most powerful love potion in the world.
600261;It's rumored to smell differently to each person, according to what attracts them.  For example, I smell freshly mown grass and new parchment and spearmint toothpaste --
600262;One of my best friends is Muggle- born.  She's the best in our year...
600263;Now Amortentia doesn't create actual love, of course.  That's impossible.  But it does cause a powerful infatuation or obsession. For that reason, it is probably the most dangerous potion in this room.
600264;Sir, you haven't told us what's in that one.
600265;Ah yes...
600266;What you see before you, ladies and gentlemen, is a curious little potion known as Felix Felicis. But it is more commonly referred to as --
600267;Liquid luck.
600268;Yes, Miss Granger.  Desperately tricky to make.  Disastrous should you get it wrong.  But brewed correctly, as this has been, it has remarkable powers.  One sip and you will find that all your endeavors succeed... at least until the effects wear off.
600269;But then why don't people drink it all the time?
600270;Because taken in excess it causes giddiness, recklessness and dangerous overconfidence.
600271;Have you ever taken it, sir?
600272;Twice.  Once when I was twenty- four.  Once when I was fifty- seven.  Two tablespoons taken at breakfast.  Two perfect days...
600273;So.  This is what I offer each of you today.  One tiny vial of liquid luck... to the student who, in the hour that remains, manages to brew an acceptable Draught of Living Death, the recipe for which can be found on page ten of your textbook.
600274;You should know that in all the years of my previous tenure at Hogwarts, not once did a student brew a potion of sufficient quality to claim this prize.  In any event -- good luck.
600275;How did you do that?
600276;Crush it.  Don't cut it.
600277;No.  The instructions specifically say to cut.
600278;No.  Really --
600279;Sh!
600280;Merlin's Beard!  But it's perfect. So perfect I daresay one sip would kill us all!  Your mother was a dab hand at potions, but this... My, my, what can't you do, m'boy? Perhaps you will save us all in the end...
600281;Here you are then, as promised. One bottle of Felix Felicis.  Use it well.
600282;Good evening, Harry.  You got my message, I see.  Come, come.  Sit.
600283;So.  How are you?
600284;Fine, sir.
600285;Enjoying your classes?  Professor Slughorn, for one, is most impressed with you.
600286;I think he overestimates my abilities, sir.
600287;Do you?
600288;Definitely.
600289;And what of your activities outside the classroom?  Do they bring you satisfaction?
600290;Sir?
600291;I notice you spend a great deal of time with Miss Granger.  One can't help but wonder if --
600292;No!  I mean... she's brilliant. And we're friends.  But... no.
600293;Forgive me, Harry, I...
600294;... I was merely curious. In any event, I'm sure you're wondering why I've summoned you here tonight.  The answer lies here.
600295;What you see before you are memories.  In this case pertaining to one individual:  Voldemort.  Or as he was known then... Tom Riddle.
600296;This vial contains a most particular memory -- of the day I first met him.  I'd like you to see it.  If you would...
600297;I must confess to a bit of confusion upon receiving your letter, Mr. Dumbledore.  In all the years Tom's been here, he's never once had a family visitor. Frankly, I was stunned to find that someone knew of his existence.
600298;I am not family.  But his name has been known to me since birth.
600299;I see...
600300;I think I should tell you.  He's a funny boy -- Tom.  Odd.  There have been incidents with the other children.  Nasty things.
600301;Perhaps you could give me an example.
600302;You've got a visitor, Tom.
600303;How do you do, Tom.
600304;Well, I'll leave you two to yourselves.
600305;Don't.
600306;As you wish.
600307;You're the doctor, aren't you?
600308;No.  I am a Professor.
600309;I don't believe you.  I hear Mrs. Cole talking, her and the rest of the staff.  They want me looked at.  They think I'm different.
600310;Perhaps they're right.
600311;I'm not mad.
600312;Hogwarts is not a place for mad people.
600313;It's a school.  A school of... magic.
600314;You can do things, can't you, Tom? Things the other children can't.
600315;Yes.
600316;Tell me some of the things you can do, Tom.
600317;I can make things move -- without touching them.  I can make animals do what I want without training them.  I can make bad things happen to people who are mean to me.  I can make them hurt... if I want.
600318;Who are you?
600319;I'm like you, Tom.  Different.
600320;Prove it.
600321;I think there is something trying to get out of your wardrobe, Tom. Open it.  Open.  It.
600322;Take it out.
600323;Is there anything in that box you ought not to have?
600324;Why did you want these things, Tom?
600325;I like having things that belonged to other people.  It makes me feel ... close to them.
600326;Thievery is not tolerated at Hogwarts.  At Hogwarts, you will be taught not only how to use magic, but to control it. Understood? I'll be going now, Tom.  Leave your window open tonight.  An owl will bring you a message.  Read it carefully.
600327;I can speak to snakes too.
600328;They find me.  Whisper things.  Is that normal.  For someone like me?
600329;It is unusual.  But not unheard of.
600330;Did you know, sir?  Then?
600331;Did I know that I had just met the most dangerous Dark Wizard of all time?  No.  Had I...
600332;Over time, while here at Hogwarts, Tom Riddle grew close to one particular teacher.  Can you guess which teacher that might be?
600333;You didn't bring Professor Slughorn back simply to teach Potions, did you, sir?
600334;No.  I did not.  You see, Professor Slughorn possesses something I desire very dearly. And he will not part with it easily... I'd rather not divulge any more just yet, Harry.  But I promise. In time you will know everything.
600335;You said Professor Slughorn would try to collect me.
600336;I did.
600337;Do you want me to let him?
600338;Yes.
600339;All right!  Queue up!  Excuse me...
600340;Shut It!
600341;Thanks.  All right.  This morning I'll be putting you all through a few drills to assess your strengths.  But know this:  Just because you made the team last year does not guarantee you a spot this year.  Is that clear?
600342;No hard feelings, Weasley, alright?
600343;Hard feelings?
600344;I'll be going out for Keeper as well.  Nothing personal.
600345;Really?  Strapping guy like you, you've got a Beater's build, don't you think?  Keeper needs to be agile, quick --
600346;I like my chances.  Say... think you could introduce me to your friend Granger?  Wouldn't mind getting on a first name basis, know what I mean?
600347;All right.  Cormac.  Ron.  It's down to you two for Keeper.  We'll decide it with a shootout. Demelza, you'll bring the Quaffle up against Cormac.  Ginny, you'll take on Ron.
600348;Hang on.  She's his sister.  How do I know she won't toss him a floater?
600349;Piss off, Cormac.  How 'bout I toss you a floater?
600350;Quiet!  I'm Captain.  We do it my way.  Now line up.  On three. One.  Two... Three!
600351;C'mon, Ron...
600352;Isn't he brilliant?
600353;Have to admit, thought I was going to miss that last one.  Hope Cormac's not taking it too hard.
600354;Has a bit of a thing for you, Hermione.  Cormac.
600355;He's vile.
600356;Ever heard of this spell?
600357;No I have not. And if you had a shred of self-respect you would turn that book in.
600358;Not bloody likely.  He's top of the class.  Even better than you, Hermione.  Slughorn thinks he's a genius.
600359;What?
600360;I'd like to know just whose book that was.  Let's take a look, shall we?
600361;No.
600362;Why not?
600363;It's... old.  The binding is fragile.
600364;The binding is fragile?
600365;Who's the Half-Blood Prince?
600366;The who?
600367;The who?
600368;That's what it says.  Right here. 'This Book is the Property of the Half-Blood Prince.'
600369;For weeks you carry around this book, practically sleep with it... and you have no desire to find out who The Half-Blood Prince is?
600370;I didn't say I wasn't curious. And, by the way, I don't sleep with it.
600371;Yeah. Right. Well, it's true.  I like a nice chat before I go to bed.  Now you're always reading that bloody book.  It's like being with Hermione.
600372;Well, I was curious.  So I went to
600373;The library.
600374;The library.
600375;And?
600376;And... nothing.  There's no reference to the Half-Blood Prince anywhere.
600377;Good.  That settles it then.
600378;Hey, you three!
600379;What've you got there, Hagrid?
600380;Stinksap.  Burn the whiskers right off yer chin.  Trees 'ere are drippin' with it.
600381;Stinksap?  You're not sick, are you?
600382;It's not fer me.  It's fer Aragog. Yeh remember Aragog, don' yeh?
600383;Spider?  About six feet tall?  Ten feet wide?
600384;Tha's the one.  He's taken ill. I'm hopin' ter nurse 'im back. Keep yer fingers crossed.
600385;Barking.  Does he not remember that raving arachnid tried to eat us? What?
600386;The Aurors. I know they're here to protect us, but... somehow I don't feel any safer.
600387;Filius!  I was hoping to find you at the Three Broomsticks.
600388;Emergency choir practice, I'm afraid, Horace.
600389;Who's up for a Butterbeer?
600390;No.  Over here.
600391;No, no.  Sit next to me.
600392;O-kay.
600393;What'll we have?
600394;Three Butterbeers.  Splash of ginger in mine, please.
600395;Aw, bloody hell...
600396;Oh, honestly, Ronald.  They're just holding hands...
600397;And snogging.
600398;I'd like to leave.
600399;Leave?  You can't be serious.
600400;That happens to be my sister.
600401;So?  What if she looked over here and saw you snogging me?  Would you expect her to get up and leave?
600402;Harry, m'boy!
600403;Hello, sir.  Wonderful to see you.
600404;So what brings you here, sir?
600405;Oh, the Three Broomsticks and I go way back.  Longer than I'd care to admit.  In fact, I remember when it was simply One Broomstick!
600406;Oops!  All hands on deck, Granger!
600407;Listen, m'boy.  In the old days, I used to throw together the occasional supper and invite a select student or two.  Would you be game?
600408;I'd consider it an honor, sir.
600409;You'd be welcome too, Granger.
600410;Be delighted, sir.
600411;Brilliant.  Look for my owl. Good to see you, Wallenby.
600412;What're you playing at?
600413;Dumbledore asked me to... get to know him.
600414;Get to know him?
600415;Dunno.  But it must be important. Otherwise Dumbledore wouldn't ask.
600416;Um... You've got a little...
600417;Bit worried about her.  Did you hear that rubbish she was talking back in the pub?  Her and me snogging.  Ha.  As if...
600418;Katie.  You don't know what it could be!
600419;What's up?
600420;I warned her!  I warned her not to touch it!
600421;Harry, she's swallowing her tongue --
600422;I'll get someone --
600423;There's no time!
600424;Get back!  All o' yeh!
600425;Now, now.  Now, now...
600426;Don' go touchin' tha' but by the wrappin's.  Unnerstan'?
600427;You're sure Katie did not have this in her possession when she entered the Three Broomsticks, Leanne?
600428;It's like I said.  She went to the loo and when she came back she had the package.  She said it was important she deliver it.
600429;Did she say to whom?
600430;All right, Leanne.  You may go. Why is it always you three?  Hm? When something happens?
600431;Believe me, Professor, I've been asking myself the same question for six years.
600432;Severus. Is this it?
600433;What do you think?
600434;I think Miss Bell is lucky to be alive.
600435;She was cursed, wasn't she?  I know Katie.  Off the Quidditch pitch she wouldn't hurt a fly.  If she was bringing that to someone, she wasn't doing it knowingly.
600436;Yes.  She was cursed.
600437;It was Malfoy.
600438;That's a very serious accusation, Potter.
600439;Indeed.  Your evidence?
600440;I... just... know.
600441;You... just... know.  Once again you astonish with your gifts, Potter, gifts mere mortals could only dream of possessing.  How grand it must be to be the Chosen One.
600442;I suggest you return to your dormitory.  All of you.
600443;What do you suppose Dean sees in her?  Ginny.
600444;What does she see in him?
600445;Dean?  He's brilliant.
600446;You called him a slick git not five hours ago.
600447;Yeah, well, he was running his hands all over my sister, wasn't he?  Something snaps.  You've got to hate him.  You know, on principle.
600448;I suppose.
600449;So what is it?  He sees in her?
600450;I don't know.  She's smart. Funny.  Attractive...
600451;Attractive?
600452;You know.  She's... got nice skin.
600453;Skin?  You're saying Dean's dating my sister because of her skin?
600454;Well, no.  I mean... I'm just saying it could be a contributing factor.
600455;Hermione's got nice skin. Wouldn't you say?  As skin goes, I mean.
600456;I've never really thought about it.  But I suppose, yeah.  Very nice.
600457;I think I'll be going to sleep now.
600458;Right.
600459;To Hogwarts' best and brightest!
600460;Here, here!
600461;Which one do I use for the soup?
600462;So tell me, Cormac.  See much of your Uncle Tiberius these days?
600463;Yes, sir.  In fact, I'm meant to go hunting with him and the Minister for Magic over holiday.
600464;Well, be sure to give them both my best.  What about your uncle, Belby?  Working on anything new? For those of you who don't know, Marcus' uncle invented the Wolfsbane Potion.
600465;Dunno.  He and me dad don't get on. Probably because Dad thinks potions are rubbish.  Says the only potion worth having is a stiff one at the end of the --
600466;And you, Miss Granger?  What is it your family does in the Muggle world?
600467;My parents are dentists.  They tend to people's teeth.
600468;Fascinating.  And is that considered a dangerous profession?
600469;No.  Though, a boy named Robbie Fenwick did bite my father once. Needed ten stitches.
600470;Miss Weasley!  Come in, come in.
600471;Sorry, I'm not ordinarily late --
600472;No matter.  You'll be just in time for dessert.  That is -- if Belby leaves you any.
600473;Look at her eyes.  They've been fighting again.  Her and Dean.
600474;What?
600475;Nothing.
600476;Thank you, one and all, for a most stimulating evening.  We'll have to do it again.
600477;Oh.  Potter.
600478;Sorry, sir, I was just admiring your hourglass.
600479;Ah, yes.  A most intriguing object.  The sands run in accordance to the quality of the conversation.  When it is stimulating, the sands run slow. When it is not...
600480;I think I'll be going.
600481;Nonsense.  You have nothing to fear, m'boy.  As for some of your classmates, well, let's just say, they're unlikely to make the shelf.
600482;The shelf, sir?
600483;Anyone who aspires to be anyone hopes to end up here.  Then again... you are already someone aren't you, Harry?
600484;I don't really know how to answer that, sir.
600485;Your mother was modest too.  Your father not so much.  As you can see, he did not make the shelf.
600486;Did Voldemort ever make the shelf, sir?
600487;You knew him, didn't you, sir? Tom Riddle.  You were his teacher.
600488;Mr. Riddle had many teachers while here at Hogwarts.
600489;What was he like?
600490;I'm sorry, sir.  Forgive me.  He killed my parents, you see...
600491;Of course.  It's only natural that you should want to know more.  I'm afraid I must disappoint you, Harry.  When I first met young Mr. Riddle, he was simply a quiet, albeit brilliant, boy committed to becoming a first-rate wizard.  Not unlike the others I've known.  In fact, not unlike... you.  If the monster existed, it was buried deep within.
600492;Good luck, eh, Ron?
600493;Counting on you, Ron.  I've two Galleons on Gryffindor.
600494;So.  How was it?
600495;How was what?
600496;Your dinner party.
600497;Dead boring.  Though I think Harry enjoyed dessert.
600498;Ol' Sluggy's having a Christmas do, you know.  And we're meant to bring someone...
600499;I expect you'll be going with McLaggen.  Isn't he a member of the Slug Club?
600500;Actually, I was going to ask you.
600501;Really?
600502;Really.  But seeing as you have such a distaste for the idea --
600503;Good luck today, Ron!  I know you'll be brilliant!
600504;I'm resigning.  After today's match.  McLaggen can have my spot.
600505;Have it your way.  Juice?
600506;Sure...
600507;Hello, everyone.  You look dreadful, Ron.
600508;Is that why you just put something in his cup.  Is it a tonic?
600509;Don't drink that, Ron!
600510;You could be expelled for that.
600511;Dunno what you're talking about.
600512;C'mon, Harry.  We've got a game to win.
600513;What's gotten into him?
600514;Ginny!  Let's go!
600515;Weasley!  Weasley!  Weasley!
600516;Ron seems to be enjoying himself.
600517;Yep.  Apparently it's his lucky day.
600518;You shouldn't have done it, Harry.
600519;Yeah.  I suppose I could've just used, I dunno... a Confundus charm?
600520;That was different.  It was tryouts.  This was an actual match --
600521;You didn't put it in? Ron only thought you did?
600522;Charms spell.  Just practicing.
600523;Ah.  Well... they're really good.
600524;How does it feel, Harry?  When you see Dean with Ginny? I know, Harry.  You're my best friend.  I see how you look at her.
600525;Oops.  I think this room's taken.
600526;What's with the birds?
600527;Oppugno!
600528;It feels like this.
600529;Look, I can't help it if she's got her knickers in a twist.  What Lav and I have -- well, let's just say there was no stopping it.  It's chemical.  Will it last?  Who knows?  Point is, I'm a free agent.
600530;He's at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes.  I really couldn't care less.  Was I under the impression that he and I would be attending Slughorn's Christmas party together?  Yes.  Of course, now, given the circumstances, I've had to make other arrangements.
600531;Have you?
600532;Yes.  Why?
600533;I just thought, you know, since neither one of us can take who we'd really like... maybe we'd go together.  As friends.
600534;Why didn't I think of that?
600535;So who are you taking?
600536;Um... it's a surprise.  Besides, it's you we need to worry about. And you can't pick just anyone. See that girl over there.  That's Romilda Vane.  Rumor has it she's trying to slip you a love potion.
600537;Really...?
600538;Hey! She's only interested in you because she thinks you're the Chosen One.  You know that, right?
600539;But I am the Chosen One.
600540;Okay.  Kidding.  I'll just ask someone I like.  Someone cool.
600541;I've never been to this part of the castle.  At least not while awake.  I sleepwalk, you see. It's why I wear shoes to bed.
600542;Someone has taken a BITE out of it. Thank you, Adrian! One of mine.  Class of '78.  I had hoped for more out of him, but at least the pictures are in focus. Oh my!  Excuse me, Harry.  I must greet the new Minister of Magical Transportation.  Class of '67. Mingle, m'boy!  Mingle!  We're all friends here.  And we run the world.
600543;Drink?
600544;Neville...?
600545;I didn't make the cut for the Slug Club.  It's okay.  He's got Belby handing out towels in the loo.
600546;Lovegood, did you say?  I once encountered a seriously unbalanced man by that name at a book signing.  Claimed to run a magazine...
600547;What're you doing?
600548;And what's happened to you?
600549;Hm?  Oh, I've just escaped -- I mean, left Cormac.  Under the mistletoe.
600550;Cormac!  That's who you invited!
600551;I thought it would annoy Ron most. But he's a menace.  He's got more tentacles than a Snarfalump plant.
600552;Dragon tartar?
600553;No thank you.
600554;Just as well.  They give one horribly bad breath.
600555;On second thought -- maybe it'll keep Cormac at bay.  Oh no, here he comes!
600556;I think she went to powder her nose.
600557;Slippery little minx, your friend. Likes to work her mouth too, doesn't she?  Yak yak yak. What is this I'm eating, by the way?
600558;Dragon balls.
600559;What's going on back here?
600560;You've just bought yourself a month's detention, McLaggen.
600561;Not so quick, Potter.
600562;I think I should rejoin the party, sir.  My date...
600563;... can surely survive your absence for another minute or two.
600564;Besides, I only wish to convey a message.
600565;A message...?
600566;From Professor Dumbledore.  He asked that I give you his best and that he hopes you enjoy your holiday.  You see, he's traveling and won't return until term resumes.
600567;Traveling?  Where?
600568;Take your hands off me,  you filthy squib!
600569;Professor Slughorn, sir!  I've just discovered this boy lurking in an upstairs corridor.  He claims to have been invited to your party.
600570;Okay, okay, I was gate-crashing. Happy?
600571;I'll escort him out.
600572;Certainly... Professor.
600573;Maybe I did hex that Bell girl. Maybe I didn't.  What's it to you?
600574;I swore to protect you.  I made the Unbreakable Vow --
600575;I don't need protection.  I was chosen for this!  Out of all others.  Me!  And I won't fail him.
600576;You're afraid, Draco.  You attempt to conceal it, but it's obvious. Let me assist you --
600577;No!  I was chosen.  This is my moment!
600578;Unbreakable Vow.  You're sure that's what Snape said.
600579;Positive.  Why?
600580;It's just, well, you can't break an Unbreakable Vow.
600581;I'd worked that much out for myself, funnily enough.
600582;No, you don't understand -- Oh, bloody hell...
600583;Lovely.
600584;All she wants to do is snog me. My lips are getting chapped. Look.
600585;I'll take your word for it.
600586;So what happens?  If you break an Unbreakable Vow?
600587;You die.
600588;Eat up, eat up, everyone!  There's more to come!
600589;Draco's plotting something, I know it, something to do with Voldemort.  He's been given a task or a mission -- and Snape was offering to help.
600590;Voldemort has chosen Draco Malfoy for a mission?
600591;I know it sounds mad --
600592;Has it occurred to you, Harry, that Snape was simply pretending to offer Draco help so that he could find out what he's up to?
600593;That's not what it sounded like.
600594;Perhaps Harry's right, Remus.  To make an Unbreakable Vow, after all --
600595;It comes down to whether or not you trust Dumbledore's judgement. He trusts Snape.  Therefore, I do.
600596;But Dumbledore can make mistakes. He's said it himself --
600597;You're blinded by hatred.
600598;I'm not --
600599;You are!  People are disappearing, Harry.  Daily.  We can only put our trust in a handful of people. If we start fighting amongst ourselves, we're doomed.
600600;Open up, you.
600601;Don't trust me?
600602;It's good.
600603;'Course 'tis.  Made them myself.
600604;You'll have to forgive Remus.  It takes its toll -- his condition.
600605;Are you alright, Mr. Weasley?
600606;We're being followed, all of us. Molly doesn't leave the house most days.  It's not been easy.
600607;Did you get my owl?
600608;Yes, but I thought it best if I replied in person.  If Dumbledore's traveling, it's news to the Ministry.  But perhaps that's the way Dumbledore wants it.  As for Draco Malfoy -- I know a bit more.
600609;Go on.
600610;I sent an agent to Borgin & Burkes.  From what you describe, I think what you and Ron saw at the end of the summer -- the object that Draco seemed so interested in -- was a Vanishing Cabinet.
600611;A Vanishing Cabinet?
600612;They were all the rage when Voldemort first rose to power. You can imagine the appeal. Should the Death Eaters come calling, one needed only slip inside and disappear for an hour or two.  But they're tricky contraptions.  Require a tremendous amount of looking after.  Eventually they fell out of favor.
600613;What happened to it?  The one at Borgin & Burkes?
600614;Nothing.  It's still there.
600615;Harry.  You know, I went through all this before -- the last time around.  Times like these -- dark times -- do funny things to people.  It can bring them together and it can tear them apart.  Things... speed up.  It's what happens when you don't know if today will be your last.
600616;It was delicious, Molly.  Really.
600617;You're sure you won't stay?
600618;No, we should go. The first night of the cycle is always the worst --
600619;Remus...?
600620;Everyone gone to bed?
600621;Soon.
600622;I don't sleep these days.  So I wash my hair.  Silly, right?
600623;Happy Christmas, Harry.
600624;Sweetheart...
600625;There's someone out there.  I can smell him.  There's more than one --
600626;Oh my god...
600627;Harry, no!
600628;Remus!
600629;Ginny, stay with your mother!
600630;No, Harry!  It's a trap!
600631;Don't you smell clean.
600632;You have to realize who you are, Harry.
600633;I know who I am, Hermione, alright?
600634;Sorry. So tell me what Arthur said.
600635;If Dumbledore's traveling places, it's news to the Ministry.  But get this:  that night at Borgin & Burkes?  It seems Draco was looking at a Vanishing Cabinet.
600636;What would Draco want with a Vanishing Cabinet?
600637;You tell me.
600638;He looks different, don't you think?  Draco.  Almost... ill.
600639;Who could tell the difference?
600640;Lav, c'mon. Of course I'll wear it.
600641;That's my Won-Won.
600642;Excuse me, I have to go vomit.
600643;Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?
600644;Now, Tom, I couldn't tell you if I knew, could I?  I must say, m'boy, I'd like to know where you get your information.  More knowledgeable than half the staff, you are. By the way, thank you for the pineapple -- you're quite right, it is my favorite -- how is it you knew?
600645;Intuition.
600646;Good gracious, look at the time. Off you go, boys, or Professor Dippett will have us all in detention.  Lestrange, Avery, don't forget your essays...
600647;Look sharp, Tom.  You don't want to be caught out of bed after hours...
600648;I know a secret shortcut or two.
600649;Yes, I imagine you do.  Something on your mind, Tom?
600650;Yes, sir.  I couldn't think of anyone else to go to.  The other professors, well, they're not like you.  They might... misunderstand.
600651;Go on.
600652;I was in the library the other night, in the Restricted section, and I read something rather odd, about a bit of rare magic, and I thought perhaps you could illuminate me...
600653;I don't know anything about such things and I wouldn't tell you if I did!  Now get out of here at once and don't ever let me catch you mentioning it again!
600654;Confused?  I would be surprised if you weren't.
600655;I don't understand -- what happened?
600656;This is perhaps the most important memory I've collected.  It's also a lie. This memory has been tampered with.  In this case by the person whose memory it is, our friend Professor Slughorn.
600657;But why would he tamper with his own memory?
600658;I suspect he is ashamed of it.
600659;Why?
600660;Why indeed.
600661;I asked you to get to know Professor Slughorn and you've done so.
600662;Now I want you to persuade him to divulge his true memory.  Any way you can.
600663;I don't know him that well, sir --
600664;You're the Chosen One, Harry.  And Horace is, at heart, a decent man. Provide the proper circumstances and he will confess his sins.
600665;This memory is everything, Harry. Without it, we are blind. Without it, we leave the fate of our world to chance.  You have no choice. You must not fail.
600666;Now don't forget to look over the chapter on antidotes.  I'll be poisoning one of you next time we meet.  I'm joking!  Off you go! Don't forget your rattails, Miss Alys.
600667;Ah! If it isn't the Prince of Potions himself!  To what do I owe the pleasure?
600668;Well, sir, I wondered if I might ask you something.
600669;Ask away, my dear boy, ask away!
600670;Well, you see, the other day I was in the Restricted Section -- in the library -- and I stumbled upon something rather odd while reading.  Something about a bit of rare magic...
600671;Yes?  And exactly what was this rare magic.
600672;I'm not sure... That is, I don't recall the name... exactly.  But it got me wondering... Are there some kinds of magic you're not allowed to teach?
600673;I'm a Potions Professor, Harry. Perhaps your question would best be posed to Professor Snape.
600674;Yes, well, we don't exactly see eye-to-eye, sir.  What I mean to say is, he's not like you.  He might... misunderstand.
600675;There can be no light without the dark.  And so it is with magic. Myself, I have always strived to live within the light.  I suggest you do the same.
600676;Did you say the same to Tom Riddle, sir?  When he came asking questions.
600677;Dumbledore put you up to this. Didn't he?  Didn't he!
600678;Sir --
600679;Dead. Did you actually expect you could just walk up to Ol' Sluggy and ask him to reveal his deepest, darkest secret?  Honestly, Harry, sometimes I think the Daily Prophet should call you the Dim One.
600680;Nice.
600681;You're going to have to persuade him somehow.  And now, I'm afraid, you've made it a lot harder.
600682;Hermione.  I think Malfoy's leaving the castle.
600683;I've seen it.  Sometimes... sometimes he just disappears off the Map.
600684;That's... not possible.  No one can leave the castle these days. The Map is wrong.
600685;The Map is never wrong.
600686;It's beautiful, isn't it?  The moon.
600687;Divine.  Had ourselves a little late-night snack, did we?
600688;It was on your bed.  The box. Thought I'd try one...
600689;Or twenty.
600690;I can't stop thinking about her, Harry.
600691;Really?  Honestly, I reckoned she was starting to annoy you.
600692;She could never annoy me.  I think... I think I love her.
600693;Excuse me?
600694;Well... Brilliant.
600695;Do you think she knows I exist?
600696;Bloody well hope so.  She's been snogging you for three months.
600697;Snogging?  Who're you talking about?
600698;Who're you talking about?
600699;Romilda, of course.  Romilda Vane.
600700;Okay.  Very funny.
600701;What the hell was that for?
600702;It's no joke!  I'm in love with her!
600703;Okay!  Fine!  You're in love with her!  Have you ever actually met her!
600704;No.  Can you introduce me?
600705;Ron, these chocolates, they're -- C'mon.  I'm going to introduce you to Romilda Vane.
600706;How do I look?
600707;Devastatingly handsome.
600708;Damn it all!
600709;Yes???!!!! Oh.  Potter.  It's you.  I'm afraid I'm busy at the moment --
600710;Sir.  I'm sorry.  I wouldn't bother you if it weren't absolutely --
600711;Where's Romilda?
600712;What's the matter with Wenby?
600713;Ah.  Very well.  Bring him in.
600714;I'd have thought you could whip up a remedy for this in no time, Harry -- an expert potioneer like you.
600715;I figured this called for a more practiced hand, sir.
600716;Hello, darling.  Fancy a drink?
600717;Hm.  Perhaps you're right.
600718;I'm sorry, sir.  About the other day.  Our... misunderstanding.
600719;Yes, well, water under the bridge as they say, correct?
600720;I mean, I'm sure you're tired of it, after all these years.  The questions.  About... Voldemort.
600721;I'll ask you not to use that name.
600722;Yes, sir.  It's just, well, Dumbledore once said that fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself.  It seemed sensible.
600723;With all due respect, Dumbledore sometimes forgets that most of us do not possess powers so great that we can risk offending the most dangerous Dark Lord who ever lived.
600724;Alright, m'boy!  Bottoms up!
600725;What's this?
600726;A tonic for the nerves.
600727;What happened to me?
600728;Love potion.
600729;And a bloody strong one at that.
600730;I feel really... bad.
600731;Pick-me-up's what you need, m'boy. Do us all good, I think.  I've got butterbeer, wine -- ah -- and a dazzling oak-matured mead.  I had other intentions for this but given the circumstances...
600732;There we are, Potter.  To life!
600733;Ron!  Ron!!!  Professor, help him!
600734;I d-don't understand --
600735;Professor!  Do something!!
600736;He's choking!!
600737;Breathe!  C'mon, Ron, don't be a prat.  Breathe!  BREATHE!
600738;These girls are gonna kill me, Harry.
600739;Quick thinking on your part, Harry.  Using a Bezoar.  You must be very proud of your student, eh, Horace?
600740;Hm?  Oh.  Yes... very proud.
600741;I think we all agree that Mr. Potter's actions were heroic.  The question is:  Why were they necessary.
600742;Why indeed.
600743;This appears to be a gift, Horace. You don't by chance remember who gave you this bottle, do you -- which by the way possesses remarkably subtle hints of licorice and cherry when not polluted with poison.
600744;Actually I had intended to give it as a gift myself.
600745;To whom might I ask?
600746;You, Headmaster.
600747;Where is he?  Where's my Won-Won! Has he been asking for me? What's she doing here?
600748;I might ask you the same.
600749;I happen to be his girlfriend.
600750;I happen to be his... friend.
600751;Don't make me laugh.  You haven't spoken in weeks.  I suppose you want to make up with him now that he's suddenly all interesting.
600752;He's been poisoned, you daft dimbo! And for the record, I've always found him interesting.
600753;Ha!  See? He senses my presence. I'm here, Won-Won. I'm here --
600754;Er... My... Nee... Er!  My!  Nee!
600755;Ah, to be young and feel love's keen sting.  Come, everyone, I think Mr. Weasley is well tended.
600756;'Bout time, don't you think?
600757;I've always cherished my students. They're my life...
600758;Oh shut up.
600759;Ron.  Stop.  You're making it snow.
600760;Huh?
600761;Tell me again how I broke up with Lavender?
600762;Um, well, she came to visit you in the hospital, you see, and you talked -- I don't believe it was a long conversation --
600763;Don't get me wrong.  I'm bloody thrilled to be shot of her.  It's just she seems... a bit put out.
600764;Does, doesn't she?  And you say you don't remember a thing from that night?  Not one thing?
600765;Well... there is... something. But no.  It can't be.  Besides, I was completely boggled, wasn't I?
600766;Right.  Boggled...
600767;That's Katie.  That's Katie Bell.
600768;How are you, Katie?
600769;Give me a moment, girls.
600770;I know you're going to ask, Harry. But I don't know who cursed me. I've tried to remember.  Honestly. But I just... can't...
600771;Cruci--
600772;Sectumsempra!
600773;Don't touch me!  Don't you dare touch me!
600774;You have to get rid of it.  Today.
600775;Take my hand.
600776;The Room of Requirement...
600777;Over the years, if someone had a secret, if they wanted to conceal something, this is where they came.  Some of these things are almost as old as the castle itself.
600778;Who showed you this?  First.
600779;Fred and George.  First year.  I hid Tom Riddle's diary here for a time.  Wish I'd left it...
600780;What was that?
600781;See, you never know what you'll find up here.
600782;All right.  Close your eyes.  That way you can't be tempted.
600783;There's something else.  Another secret of sorts.  One of mine...
600784;That can stay hidden up here too, if you like.
600785;So.  Did you and Ginny do it?
600786;What?
600787;You know.  Hide the book.
600788;Oh.  Yeah.
600789;Still no luck with Slughorn, I take it?
600790;Say that again.
600791;Well?  How do you feel?
600792;Excellent.  Really excellent.
600793;Now remember.  Slughorn usually eats early, takes a short walk and then returns to his office.
600794;Right.  I'm going down to Hagrid's.
600795;What?  No, Harry -- you've got to go see Slughorn.  We have a plan --
600796;No.  I've got a good feeling about going to Hagrid's.  I feel like it's the place to be tonight, know what I mean?
600797;No.
600798;No.
600799;Trust me.  I know what I'm doing. Or at least Felix does.
600800;Merlin's beard, Harry!
600801;Sorry, sir.  I should've announced myself.  Cleared my throat. Coughed.  You probably feared I was Madam Sprout.
600802;Well, yes, actually -- Why would you think that?
600803;Just the general behavior, sir. The sneaking around.  The jumping when you saw me.  By the way, those Tentacula leaves -- they're quite valuable, aren't they?
600804;Ten galleons a leaf to the right buyer -- not that I'm familiar with such back alley transactions. One hears rumors is all.  My own interests are purely academic, of course.
600805;Personally, these plants have always kind of freaked me out.
600806;Exactly how did you get out of the castle, Harry?
600807;Through the front doors, sir.  I'm off to Hagrid's, you see.  He's a very dear friend and I felt like paying him a visit.  So if you don't mind, I'll be going.
600808;Harry!
600809;Sir?
600810;It's nearly nightfall.  Surely you realize I can't allow you to roam the grounds all by yourself.
600811;Well, then by all means come along, sir.
600812;Harry, I must insist you accompany me back to the castle immediately!
600813;That would be counterproductive, sir.
600814;And what makes you say that?
600815;No idea.
600816;Merlin's beard...
600817;Is that an actual Acromantula?
600818;A dead one, I think, sir.
600819;'Arry.  'Orace.
600820;My god, dear man.  How did you ever manage to kill it?
600821;Kill 'im! Me oldest friend, 'e was!
600822;I'm sorry, I... didn't realize.
600823;Ah, don' worry yerself.  Yer not alone.  Seriously misunderstood creatures -- spiders.  It's the eyes, I reckon.  Unnerve people.
600824;Not to mention the pincers.
600825;I reckon that too... How'd yeh get outta the castle anyways?
600826;Through the front doors.
600827;Hagrid.  I wouldn't want to be indelicate, but Acromantula venom is uncommonly rare and, well, if you wouldn't mind my extracting a vial or two -- purely for academic pursuits...
600828;Don' suppose it's doin' 'im any good, izzit?
600829;My thoughts exactly!  Always carry a few spare ampoules for just such occasions.  Old Potion Master's habit, you know...
600830;Wish yeh coulda seen 'im in 'is prime.  Magnificent 'e was.  Jus' magnificent...
600831;Why don't I say a few words?  I trust he had family?
600832;Oh yeah.
600833;Farewell...
600834;Aragog.
600835;Farewell, Aragog, king of arachnids.  Though your body will decay, your spirit lingers on in the quiet, web-spun places of your Forest home.  May your many-eyed descendents ever flourish and your human friends find solace for the loss they have sustained.
600836;Tha' was... tha' was... beautiful.
600837;And Odo the hero, they bore him back home...
600838;To the place he'd known as a lad, They laid him to rest with his hat inside out and his wand snapped in two, which was sad...
600839;I had 'im from an egg, yeh know. Tiny little thing he was when he hatched.  No bigger'n a Pekinese.
600840;Sweet.  I once had a fish. Francis.  Lovely little thing. One day I came downstairs and he'd vanished.  Poof.
600841;Tha's odd.
600842;Isn't it?  That's life, I suppose. One goes along and then... poof.
600843;That's never unicorn hair, Hagrid?
600844;Hagrid looks up, reels a bit.  Nods.
600845;But my dear chap, do you know how much that's worth?
600846;No idea... no idea at all...
600847;It was a student who gave me Francis.  One spring afternoon I discovered a bowl upon my desk with a few inches of clear water. There was a flower petal floating upon the surface.  As I watched, the petal sank, but just before it touched bottom... it transformed. Into a wee fish.  It was beautiful magic, wondrous to behold.  The petal had come from a lily.
600848;Your mother.  The day I came downstairs, the day I found the bowl empty... was the day she...
600849;I know what you want.  But I can't give it to you.  It will ruin me...
600850;Do you know why I survived?  The night I got this.
600851;Because of her.  Because she sacrificed herself.  Because she refused to step aside.  Because her love was more powerful than Voldemort.
600852;Please don't say his --
600853;I'm not afraid of the name, Professor.  And I'm not afraid of him.  And you shouldn't be either. She didn't just die for me that night.  She died for you too.  She died for everyone who's ever woken in the middle of the night afraid a Death Eater waited on their doorstep.
600854;Professor.  I'm going to tell you something, something others have only guessed at.  It's true.  I am the Chosen One.
600855;Only I can kill him.  But in order to do so, I need to know what Tom Riddle asked you that night in your office all those years ago. And I need to know what you told him.
600856;Be brave, Professor.  Be brave like my mother.  Otherwise you disgrace her.  Otherwise she died for nothing.  Otherwise, the bowl remains empty forever.
600857;Don't think too badly of me once you've seen it.  You don't know what he was like... even then.
600858;How is he?  Horace?
600859;Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?
600860;Now, Tom, I couldn't tell you if I knew, could I?  I must say, m'boy, I'd like to know where you get your information.  More knowledgable than half the staff, you are. By the way, thank you for the pineapple -- you're quite right, it is my favorite -- how is it you knew?
600861;Intuition.
600862;Good gracious, is it that time already?  Off you go, boys, or Professor Dippett will have us all in detention.  Lestrange, Avery, don't forget your essays...
600863;Look sharp, Tom.  You don't want to be caught out of bed after hours...
600864;I know a secret shortcut or two.
600865;Yes, I imagine you do.  Something on your mind, Tom?
600866;Yes, sir.  I couldn't think of anyone else to go to.  The other Professors, well, they're not like you.  They might... misunderstand.
600867;Go on.
600868;I was in the library the other night, in the Restricted section, and I read something rather odd, about a bit of rare magic and I thought perhaps you could illuminate me.  It's called, as I understand it... a Horcrux.
600869;Excuse me?
600870;Horcrux.  I came across the term while reading and I didn't fully understand it.
600871;I'm not sure what you were reading, Tom, but that's very Dark stuff, very Dark indeed.
600872;Yes, sir.  Which is why I came to you.  I mean no disrespect to the rest of the staff, but I thought if anyone could tell me... it would be you.
600873;A Horcrux is an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul.
600874;Yes, I thought it might be something like that.  But I don't understand how that works, sir.
600875;One splits one's soul and hides part of it in an object.  By doing so, you are protected should you be attacked and your body destroyed.
600876;Protected?
600877;That part of your soul that was hidden, lives on.  In other words, you cannot die.
600878;How does one split his soul, sir?
600879;I think you can guess the answer to that, Tom.
600880;Murder.
600881;Yes.  Killing rips the soul apart. It is a violation against nature. After, one is never the same.
600882;Out of curiosity, sir -- can you only split your soul once?  For instance, isn't seven the most powerfully magical number --
600883;Seven!  Merlin's beard, Tom! Isn't it bad enough to think of killing one person?  To rip the soul into seven pieces...
600884;This is all hypothetical, isn't it, Tom?  All academic...
600885;Of course, sir.  And I promise I'll not speak of our conversation.  It'll be our little secret...
600886;Sir --
600887;This is beyond anything I imagined.  In my life I have seen things that are unimaginably horrific.  I know now... you will see worse.
600888;Do you mean to say he succeeded, sir?  In making a Horcrux?
600889;Oh he succeeded.  And not just once.  Think, Harry.  He's just told us.
600890;Seven.  He made seven -- the most powerfully magical number.  But... what are they exactly?
600891;They can be anything.  The most commonplace of objects.  A ring, for example.  Or a book...
600892;Tom Riddle's diary --
600893;It's a Horcrux, yes.  Four years ago, when you saved Ginny Weasley's life in the Chamber of Secrets, when you brought me this I knew.  This was a different kind of magic.  Very dark.  Very powerful.  But until tonight, I had no idea just how powerful...
600894;And the ring...?
600895;Belonged to Voldemort's mother. It was difficult to find and...
600896;... even more difficult to destroy. But if you could find them all. If you did destroy each Horcrux...
600897;One destroys Voldemort.
600898;But how would you find them?  They could be hidden anywhere, couldn't they...
600899;True.  But magic, especially Dark magic...
600900;... leaves traces.
600901;It's where you've been going, isn't it, sir?  When you leave the school.
600902;Yes.  And I think... perhaps... I may have found another.  But this time I cannot hope to destroy it alone.
600903;Once again, I shall ask too much of you.
600904;Harry.  It's time.
600905;Hermione, is the Room of Requirement unplottable?
600906;If one wants it to be.  Why?
600907;It would explain why I thought Malfoy was leaving the castle when he disappeared off the Map.
600908;He was going to the Room of Requirement.
600909;Of course, and that explains the Vanishing Cabinet as well!
600910;No.  I got an owl from Dad this morning.  The one at Borgin & Burke's?  It's still there.
600911;But I'm telling you.  I saw it --
600912;What if there are two?  Vanishing cabinets.
600913;What if there are?
600914;I don't know...
600915;Good luck, mate.
600916;I don't need luck.  I'll be with Dumbledore.
600917;Have you ever considered that you ask too much?  That you take too much for granted?  Has it ever crossed your brilliant mind that I don't want to do this anymore?
600918;Whether it has or hasn't is irrelevant.  I will not negotiate this with you, Severus.  You agreed.  There's nothing more to discuss.
600919;Harry.  You need a shave, my friend.
600920;At times I forget how much you've grown.  At times I still see the small boy from the cupboard. Forgive my mawkishness, Harry.  I am an old man.
600921;You look the same to me, sir.
600922;Like your mother, you are unfailingly kind.
600923;A trait people never fail to undervalue.  I'm afraid.
600924;The place to which we journey tonight is exceedingly dangerous, Harry.  I promised that you could accompany me and I stand by that promise.  But there is a condition:  You must obey any command I give you -- without question.
600925;Yes, sir.
600926;Understand what I'm saying. Should I tell you to hide, you must hide.
600927;Should I tell you to run, you will run.
600928;And should I tell you to abandon me and save yourself...
600929;You will do so.
600930;Your word, Harry.
600931;My word.
600932;Take my arm.
600933;Sir, I thought one couldn't Apparate within Hogwarts.
600934;Being me has its privileges.
600935;It's there, isn't it?
600936;This is the place.  Oh yes, this place has known magic. Where you stand, Harry, Tom Riddle once stood many, many years ago, when he was but a poor orphan boy with a penchant for cruelty...
600937;One wintry afternoon, he lured two younger classmates to this cave. What happened is unclear.  But this much is known:  the children were damaged.
600938;Sir!
600939;In order to gain passage, payment must be made, payment intended to weaken any intruder.
600940;You should've let me, sir.
600941;Oh, no, Harry.  Your blood is much more precious than mine.
600942;Careful.  The water.
600943;It's there.  The only question is how do we get to it?
600944;We couldn't, perhaps, just try a Summoning Charm, sir?
600945;Accio Horcrux!
600946;Perhaps not.
600947;If you would, Harry...
600948;Sir... have you ever taken Felix Felicis?
600949;Only recreationally.  You see, I believe one creates one's own luck.
600950;Professor... there are bodies in this lake.
600951;Yes.
600952;Remember... the water.
600953;Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir?
600954;Oh yes.
600955;It has to be drunk.
600956;You remember the condition on which I brought you with me? This potion might paralyze me.  It might cause me to forget why I'm here.  It might create so much pain I beg for relief.  You are not to indulge these requests, Harry.  It is your job to make sure I keep drinking this potion even if you have to force it down my throat.  Understood?
600957;Why can't I drink it, sir?
600958;Because I am much older, much cleverer... and much less valuable. Your good health, Harry.
600959;Professor?
600960;Professor?  Can you hear me?
600961;Don't... don't make me...
600962;You... you can't stop, Professor. You've got to keep drinking.  Like you said.  Remember.
600963;Nooooooo!!!
600964;Make it stop... Please... make it stop...
600965;It will, sir.  It'll stop.  But only if you drink...
600966;My fault.  It's all my fault...
600967;Too much... I can't... take it... I want... to die... kill... kill me... KILL ME, HARRY!
600968;What?
600969;Your word, Harry!  Your word!
600970;No...
600971;Kill me!  It's the only way!
600972;One more.  Just one more.  And then -- I promise... I'll do what you say.
600973;I promise.
600974;Water. Water...
600975;Aguamenti.
600976;You did it, sir.  Look --
600977;Water!
600978;I'm trying, sir.  I'm --
600979;Go...
600980;We have to... go.
600981;Don't worry, sir.  We're nearly there.
600982;I am not worried, Harry.  I am with you.
600983;To your Houses.  No dawdling.
600984;We need to get you up to the hospital, sir, to Madam Pomfrey --
600985;No.  Severus... Severus is who I need... Go and wake him... Tell him what has happened...
600986;Speak to no one else... I... I shall wait here...
600987;All right.  Okay.
600988;Sir, are you... praying?
600989;No, Harry.  I do not pray.  I was merely closing a window -- the one that had allowed us to Apparate.
600990;Hide yourself below.  And do not speak or show yourself without my permission.  No matter what.
600991;Do as I say, Harry.
600992;Trust me.
600993;Good evening, Draco.  What brings you out on such a fine Spring evening?  Or is it Summer?
600994;Who else is here?  I heard you talking.
600995;I often talk aloud to myself.  I find it extraordinarily useful. That which sounds sane at a whisper can seem utterly mad when said for all the world to hear. Haven't been whispering to yourself, have you, Draco?
600996;You are not an assassin, Draco.
600997;How do you know what I am?  I've done things that would shock you.
600998;Like cursing Katie Bell and hoping she would, in turn, bear a cursed necklace to me?  Like replacing a bottle of mead with one laced with poison.  Forgive me, Draco, but these are attempts so feeble I cannot help but question if your heart has been really in them. I'm curious.  When Voldemort gave you this task, when he asked you to kill me, was it in a whisper?
600999;He trusts me!  I was chosen!
601000;Then I shall make it easy for you.
601001;Expelliarumus!
601002;Well done, Draco.  But I warn you. Killing is not nearly as easy.
601003;You're not alone.  Are you.  There are others.  How?
601004;The Vanishing Cabinet in the Room of Requirement.
601005;That cabinet has been broken for years.
601006;I've been mending it.
601007;Ingenious.  Let me guess.  It has a sister.  A twin.
601008;In Borgin & Burkes.  They form --
601009;A passage, yes.  Very good. I once knew a boy years ago who made all the wrong choices.  Let me help you, Draco.
601010;I don't want your help!  Don't you see!  I have to do it!  I have to! I've got to kill you or he'll kill me.
601011;Say that again, Draco.  But aloud this time.
601012;Well now, look what we have here. Dumbledore.  Wandless and alone.
601013;Cornered in his own castle.  Well done, Draco.
601014;Good evening, Bellatrix.  I think introductions are in order.
601015;Love to, Albus.  But I'm afraid we're on a bit of a tight schedule.
601016;Do it.
601017;He doesn't have the stomach.  Like his father.  Let me finish him. In my own way.
601018;No!  The Dark Lord was clear.  The boy's to do it.  Go on, Draco. Now!
601019;No.
601020;Severus...
601021;Well, look who's here.  Hogwarts own Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.  Come to see the slaughter?
601022;Severus... please.
601023;I gave my word.  I made a vow...
601024;Avada Kedavra!
601025;You can no longer stay here.
601026;Boo.
601027;Draco!  Draco! They'll kill you if you stay.
601028;Go on!
601029;Go on!
601030;Cruciatus!
601031;Incacerata!
601032;Impedimenta!
601033;Fight!  Fight back, you coward!
601034;Don't ever associate that word and my name again.
601035;No!  He belongs to the Dark Lord!
601036;Sectumsempra!
601037;You dare use my own spells against me, Potter?
601038;You may have gotten your mother's eyes, but you're as dim as your father.  Yes.  It's me.  I'm the Half-Blood Prince.
601039;Hagrid... HAGRID!
601040;Hagrid!  You alright?
601041;Take more'n tha' ter finish me off.  Not sure about me 'ouse, tho'.  But if anybody can put it righ', Dumbledore can.
601042;Hagrid, Dumbledore --
601043;Only thing I can't reckon is wha' Snape was doin' with tha' lot.
601044;An' wha's this wi' the Dark Mar'? Who's been killed? Where's Dumbledore, 'arry? Where's Dumbledore!!
601045;Potter.
601046;Potter, in light of what's happened... should you feel the need to talk to someone...
601047;You should know... Professor Dumbledore...
601048;You meant a great deal to him.
601049;Dumbledore.
601050;Do you think he would've done it. Draco?
601051;No.  He was lowering his wand.  In the end, it was Snape.  It was always Snape.  And I did nothing...
601052;Strange.  Thinking this is a piece of Voldemort's soul...
601053;Yeah, strange.  Only... it's not. It's a fake.
601054;Go on.  Open it.
601055;'To the Dark Lord.  I know I will be dead long before you read this but I want you to know that it was I who discovered your secret.  I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can.  I face death in the hope that when you meet your match, you will be mortal once more.  R.A.B.'
601056;Dunno.  But whoever they are, they have the real Horcrux.  Which means, it was a waste.  All of it.
601057;Ron's okay with it, you know.  You and Ginny.  But if I were you, when he's around, I'd keep the snogging to a minimum.
601058;I'm not coming back, Hermione.
601059;We reckoned -- Ron and me.
601060;I have to finish what Dumbledore started. I'm not sure where that will lead me... but I'll let you and Ron konw where I am -- when I can.
601061;I've always admired your courage, Harry, but sometimes... you're really thick.
601062;You don't honestly think you can find all those Horcruxes by yourself, do you? You need us, Harry.
601063;Yeah.  I do.  But do me a favor. When I'm around?  Keep the snogging to a minimum.
601064;Like that's going to happen.
601065;Besides, he's barking.
601066;Funny, he says the same about you.
601067;Yes, but I'm exceptionally perceptive.
601068;You're brilliant.  You both are.
601069;Do you think we'll ever... come back?
601070;I don't know. I never realised how beautiful this place was.
